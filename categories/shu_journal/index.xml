for my graduate program. I graduated in June, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to give this
place a new purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into what kind of thing this site should morph into,
and I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite decided yet. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll start doing book reviews, but
we&amp;rsquo;ll see. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll post the occasional thought and progress as I work
toward publication.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/10/17/thoughts-on-the-exorcist-by-william-peter-blatty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/10/17/thoughts-on-the-exorcist-by-william-peter-blatty/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most people should be familiar with Blatty&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/b3hfZd">&lt;em>The Exorcist&lt;/em>&lt;/a> by now. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s a classic, right?
The mere mention of the title suggests Linda Blair spewing ungodly amounts of
pea soup. So no introduction is necessary. It is definitely a great horror novel
that everyone with even a minor interest in horror should read. Go read it. Now.
I mean it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, all due praise aside, there are two things about the novel that stood out
for me as a writer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Ansen Dibell’s “Plot”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/09/28/thoughts-on-ansen-dibells-plot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/09/28/thoughts-on-ansen-dibells-plot/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most challenging things I struggle with as both a writer of fiction
and a student of literature (yeah, they always go together) is which tool to use
when. I believe that while reading and writing are intricately related&amp;ndash;you must
be well-read to be well-written&amp;ndash;they don&amp;rsquo;t use the same mental tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The term plot (my archenemy when it comes to writing) appears in both toolkits,
and I think that is terribly confusing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Nate Kenyon’s “Sparrow Rock”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/08/24/thoughts-on-nate-kenyons-sparrow-rock/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/08/24/thoughts-on-nate-kenyons-sparrow-rock/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just finished reading &lt;a href="http://www.natekenyon.com">Nate Kenyon&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s latest novel,
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Rock-Nate-Kenyon/dp/0843963778/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1270214210&amp;amp;sr=1-1">&lt;em>Sparrow Rock&lt;/em>&lt;/a>,
a story of a group of high school kids who find themselves trapped in a bomb
shelter by accident just as the end of the world arrives. Read the official
synopsis from &lt;a href="http://natekenyon.com/sparrow-rock-synopsis">Nate&amp;rsquo;s site&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The novel has received excellent reviews at multiple sites, and I think the
praise is well-deserved. Kenyon has produced a fast-paced, engaging tale of
survival. This is the second book I&amp;rsquo;ve read by Kenyon. I read
&lt;em>&lt;a href="http://natekenyon.com/fiction/bloodstone-synopsis/2005/11/22">Bloodstone&lt;/a>&lt;/em>
some months back as a sample of a first novel, but have yet to get to a post on
it. I thought it an excellent tale as well, and I will keep his work at the top
of my list from here on out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Bently Little’s “The Town”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/08/08/thoughts-on-bently-littles-the-town/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/08/08/thoughts-on-bently-littles-the-town/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/ayRVNF">Bently Little&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/a5BpnT">&lt;em>The Town&lt;/em>&lt;/a> was
published in 2000, and I think even 10 years later it holds up as a good story.
I found Bently&amp;rsquo;s take on small-town horror refreshing in many ways, even though
the idea of horror in a small town isn&amp;rsquo;t so unique by today&amp;rsquo;s standards. The
story involves a family of six who move back to the father&amp;rsquo;s home town after
winning the lottery to simplify their lives and exchange the dangers of LA for
the assumed tranquility of McGuane, Arizona.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Character Matters</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/07/05/why-character-matters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/07/05/why-character-matters/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just finished reading &lt;a href="http://www.edwardleeonline.com/">Edward Lee&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/cjs1rX">&lt;em>The Golem&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. This is my first encounter with any of
Edward Lee&amp;rsquo;s work. I believe every author should have two chances, so Ed Lee has
one left. To me, the book read like a first draft, but I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t see the golem used much in popular fiction. I can only recall one
instance where I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it used&amp;ndash;an old episode of the X-Files called
&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/campOV">&lt;em>Kaddish&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Lee brings the reader a modern version of an
old Jewish folk tale based on &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/bArhVJ">Judah Loew&lt;/a>, a 16th century
rabbi who created a golem to defend a Prague ghetto from anti-Semitic attacks.
Lee brings the folktale to life with vibrant rituals and an exploration of a
dark sect of Kabbalah based on Kischuph. The story revolves around the small
town of Lowensport, Maryland. In 1880, a group of Jewish refugees from Prague,
led by the evil rabbi Gavriel Loew, construct two golems to defend themselves
from the attack of the Conner clan, a local group of settlers lead by an
ex-military deserter. The story is told in parallel with the present-day tale of
Seth Kohn and his girlfriend Judy, who move into the old Lowen mansion and find
themselves in the middle of a plan by Gavriel&amp;rsquo;s great-great-great grandson to
resurrect Gavriel as a golem and&amp;ndash;you guessed it&amp;ndash;take over the world, or at
least small part of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Manuscript Templates</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/06/09/manuscript-templates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/06/09/manuscript-templates/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part of being a professional writer is ensuring your submissions meet format
guidelines. &lt;a href="http://www.shunn.net/format/">William Shunn&lt;/a> developed a set of
format guidelines, originally published in December 1998 edition of
&lt;a href="http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/dec98/shunn.htm">Writers Write: The Internet Writing Journal&lt;/a>.
He also provides a set of &lt;a href="http://www.shunn.net/format/wp.html">templates&lt;/a> on
his site, but unfortunately they are only for WordPerfect. I use
&lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to create my own templates based on his guidelines and offer them here
for all to use. I emailed Mr. Shunn several times over the past year to ask
permission to post these, and never received a response. I decided to go ahead
and offer them anyhow, and if Mr. Shunn objects, I will remove them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One Helluva Ghost Story</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/04/27/one-helluva-ghost-story/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/04/27/one-helluva-ghost-story/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just finished reading Tom Piccirilli&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>A Choir of Ill Children&lt;/em>&amp;ndash;for the
second time. I read it back in February and decided that to do it any justice, I
needed to set it aside and reread it. It&amp;rsquo;s not an overly complex book, but I&amp;rsquo;m
not used to the Southern style. The last book I read that felt stylistically
similar was Faulkner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>As I Lay Dying&lt;/em>&amp;ndash;over fifteen years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing that I noticed is the uniqueness of every character. I was
familiar with the book prior to reading it, and had an admittedly biased
expectation that at least some of the characters would be backwater rednecks.
Piccirilli, however, invests each character with a distinct personality that I
don&amp;rsquo;t believe fit any stereotypes. Further, I expected at least some of the
dialog to have poor diction. Again, I was totally wrong. Most of the dialog uses
good diction&amp;ndash;Piccirilli makes very prudent use of &amp;ldquo;ain&amp;rsquo;t&amp;quot;s throughout, for
which I&amp;rsquo;m grateful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another Round of How-To, Part 3</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/04/07/another-round-of-how-to-part-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/04/07/another-round-of-how-to-part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the last of a three-part journal on &lt;em>How to Write Tales of Horror,
Fantasy &amp;amp; Science Fiction&lt;/em>, Edited by J. N. Williamson, a collection of How-To
articles by some of the best horror writers, circa 1987.
&lt;a href="../2010/03/01/another-round-of-how-to/index.html">Part one&lt;/a> covered chapters
1-8; &lt;a href="https://www.davidlday.com/2010/03/23/another-round-of-how-to-part-2/">part two&lt;/a> covered chapters
9-18.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advice found in these final chapters still mirrors advice found in the
wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.horror.org/hwabooks.htm#write_horr">&lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em>&lt;/a>,
another collection of How-To articles by some of horror&amp;rsquo;s best writers
circa 2007. But here&amp;rsquo;s one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from reading both books (and a
slew of other How-To books) that&amp;rsquo;s not actually in either. I&amp;rsquo;m sick of reading
How-To books on writing. In my genre session during last writer&amp;rsquo;s residency,
&lt;a href="http://gorelets.com/">Dr. Arnzen&lt;/a> commented that if all you read are how-to
books, then all you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write are how-to books. I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to
appreciate his statement. With that, let me get through this and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll
be done with anything How-To for a while.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another Round of How-To, Part 2</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/03/23/another-round-of-how-to-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/03/23/another-round-of-how-to-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is part two of a three-part journal on &lt;em>How to Write Tales of Horror,

&lt;a href="https://www.davidlday.com/2010/03/01/another-round-of-how-to/">Part one&lt;/a> covered chapters 1-8.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my first post, I mentioned how strikingly similar the advice is to that found
in &lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em>, another collection of How-To articles by some of
horror&amp;rsquo;s best writers circa 2007. I&amp;rsquo;ve still found this to hold true. I don&amp;rsquo;t
mean that as a slight against either work, as the essays in both are unique to
the authors. For me, this reinforces that the advice found within each work has
a certain timeless quality to it even though markets have changed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another Round of How-To</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/03/01/another-round-of-how-to/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/03/01/another-round-of-how-to/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first of three posts on &lt;em>How to Write Tales of Horror, Fantasy &amp;amp;
Science Fiction&lt;/em>, Edited by J. N. Williamson. The book is a collection of How-To
articles by some of the best horror writers, circa 1987.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Late last year I did a series of posts on &lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em>, another
collection of How-To articles by some of horror&amp;rsquo;s best writers circa 2007.
Twenty years separate the publication of these two books, but so far I haven&amp;rsquo;t
found anything other than the market survey that really differentiate the two.
I&amp;rsquo;ve commented before that information repeated across authors is usually good
advice, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s still true. But, I&amp;rsquo;m a little disappointed that I
haven&amp;rsquo;t found anything new here. Yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measuring Quality – Words or Pages</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/01/31/measuring-quality-words-or-pages/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/01/31/measuring-quality-words-or-pages/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a couple of weeks into my second term in
&lt;a href="http://http://www.setonhill.edu/academics/fiction/index.cfm">Seton Hill&amp;rsquo;s MA WPF&lt;/a>
program. My thesis is a marketable horror novel, targeted at 350 pages. My
personal goal is to complete the 1st draft by the end of this term, and spend
the rest of my program editing and revision. Or rewriting if my mentors so
command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of that is particularly interesting, but they&amp;rsquo;re facts that lay the
groundwork for what&amp;rsquo;s been on my mind lately. Every professional writer develops
their own flavor of discipline, without which they would be unable to sustain
professional standing. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty common among most successful people
regardless of profession to develop a habit around their chosen work. What I&amp;rsquo;ve
been interested in is how writers measure their progress?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Back to work...</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/01/08/back-to-work/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2010/01/08/back-to-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just got back from residency orientation @ Seton Hill. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be back,
even if it meant driving 4 hours through snow. I had a great break, had a couple
of good reads while I was off. First was John Scalzi&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War&lt;/em>, a very
entertaining science fiction book. It&amp;rsquo;s not my typical flavor, but it kept me
reading, full of good action and interesting characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My other read was &lt;em>The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror, Volume 20&lt;/em>, edited by
Stephen Jones. It&amp;rsquo;s filled with some excellent short horror from 2008, and
definitely worth the time. It&amp;rsquo;s late, I&amp;rsquo;m tired, so I won&amp;rsquo;t do any sort of
review of them, but here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the one&amp;rsquo;s that appealed most to me:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Bit of a Break</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/12/01/a-bit-of-a-break/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/12/01/a-bit-of-a-break/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on break from school since beginning of November, so I took the
opportunity to brush up on mechanics. Specifically, I took a much-needed browse
through the old &lt;em>Elements of Style&lt;/em>. Good little book. But, I wanted more. So, I
found a more contemporary take on style, &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/633eMV">Sin and Syntax&lt;/a>,
by Constance Hale. It&amp;rsquo;s longer than Elements. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of praise for the
book out in the wild; I&amp;rsquo;ll say I&amp;rsquo;m glad I took the time to read it as well. How
do I know? Some of my writing from as recent as a year ago makes me cringe.
[sigh] Shortly after I finished, I set about some serious revision work on a few
older short stories.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Down to Business</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/21/down-to-business/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/21/down-to-business/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the end, writing is like any other endeavor. Sure, there is a significant and
compelling creative aspect to it, almost mystical at times. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t just
happen, though. The magic comes through sweat and rigor. King lays this out in
his final section of &lt;em>On Writing&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His opinion is that there are 4 classes of writer: Bad, Competent, Good, and
Genius. He states that there are 2 theses to his book:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tools of the Trade</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/18/tools-of-the-trade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/18/tools-of-the-trade/</guid><description>&lt;p>In part two of On Writing, King gives an overview of what he considers the
essential tools for every writer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox. The analogy is interesting, and the
story he provides at the start demonstrates an excellent point: Always have all
your tools with you so you can tackle any unexpected situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what goes in this metaphorical toolbox?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first layer consists of common tools. The most common tool, per King, is
vocabulary. It&amp;rsquo;s something we all have to varying degrees. I really appreciate
King&amp;rsquo;s take on vocabulary, which is essentially, learn to use what you have and
don&amp;rsquo;t worry about developing more. Your vocabulary develops as a by-product of
reading. All writers are readers first, right?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Fogged-Out Landscape</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/17/a-fogged-out-landscape/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/17/a-fogged-out-landscape/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful how much we can learn from stories, particularly when well told.
Stephen King spends the first part of his book, &lt;em>On Writing&lt;/em>, by walking the
reader through a series of &amp;lsquo;fogged-out&amp;rsquo; memories. The book itself is about
writing. But he sets the stage by doing what he does best, and tells the story
of what made him what he is today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t say if it was intentional on his part, but in telling what he considers
his &amp;ldquo;C.V.&amp;rdquo;, King demonstrates a series of important lessons that were critical
in shaping him. Notice I said demonstrate. I think this is, perhaps, one of the
first aspects he teaches us. His book is about writing, but instead of listing
out a series of lessons, he shows us what he learned and how he learned it. It
is a vehement adherence to the old adage of &amp;ldquo;show, don&amp;rsquo;t tell&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve read too
many books and articles on writing that do little more than list out rules or
guidelines or maxims or adages or aphorisms or whatever word you want to use.
But, in the end, they&amp;rsquo;re nothing more than a handful of words on a page that
leave the reader with little more than a sense that there&amp;rsquo;s something to
memorize. There&amp;rsquo;s no feeling in the lessons they impart, no connection to the
reader. Just rules.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“On Writing… oh, to hell with it.</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/15/on-writing-oh-to-hell-with-it/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2009 02:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/15/on-writing-oh-to-hell-with-it/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last section of &amp;ldquo;On Writing Horror&amp;rdquo; is all about the business aspect of

resources for research and promotion, and some worthwhile advice from editors
and writers alike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the advice I&amp;rsquo;m taking right now, given by &lt;em>Night Shade Books&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Write what you think is your best book. Put it in a trunk and write another
one. Do this four times.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Archetypes and Fearful Allure: Writing Erotic Horror, &lt;em>Nancy Kilpatrick&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really struggled with this one. Kilpatrick seems to rely heavily on the
concept of Archetypes, and the crux of her advice can be summed up in the
following quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This means that the energy embedded in the image resonates with all readers
because it taps into and stirs up the collective unconscious.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“On Writing Horror” – Part Six</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/11/on-writing-horror-part-six/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/11/on-writing-horror-part-six/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part 6 of &lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em> is titled &amp;ldquo;Tradition and Modern Times&amp;rdquo;, a series

&lt;p>&lt;strong>No More Silver Mirrors: The Monster in Our Times, &lt;em>Karen E. Taylor&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taylor addresses how the old monsters can be made new again. She&amp;rsquo;s got some good
advice, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that in a second, but there&amp;rsquo;s something she says early
on that is direct opposition to what at least one other author claims in this
series of articles.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Innovation in Horror, &lt;em>Jeanne Cavelos&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see patterns of advice in these articles, even though they have
different emphasis. Cavelos talks in terms of innovation, but starts with the
foundational advice of read a lot, read both in and out of the genre. Doing so
helps the amateur writer avoid writing something that&amp;rsquo;s old under the false
belief that they&amp;rsquo;ve written something new. Fair enough, know what&amp;rsquo;s been done
before so you can truly come up with something knew.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“On Writing Horror” – Part Four</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/07/on-writing-horror-part-four/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/07/on-writing-horror-part-four/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part 4 of &lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em> is titled &amp;ldquo;Horror Crafting&amp;rdquo;, and encompasses 7
articles on the craft. So many articles, and much of it is advice I&amp;rsquo;ve heard
before, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep this as short as I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Such Horrible People&lt;/em>, Tina Jens&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Per Jens, &amp;ldquo;Horror is about how people react &lt;em>when they encounter&lt;/em> the plot.&amp;rdquo; So
to have good horror, we need good characters who interact with the plot. That&amp;rsquo;s
nothing new to me, and it&amp;rsquo;s sound advice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“On Writing Horror” – Part Three</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/04/on-writing-horror-part-three/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/04/on-writing-horror-part-three/</guid><description>&lt;p>Part 3 of &lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em> is titled &amp;ldquo;Developing Horror Concepts&amp;rdquo;. It
contains four articles dealing with conceiving and developing ideas for horror.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>A World of Dark and Disturbing Ideas&lt;/em>, J. N. Williamson&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Williamson chooses to speak in terms of &amp;ldquo;useful premise&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;idea&amp;rdquo;,
and I can appreciate his working definition. Idea&amp;rsquo;s are great, but they are
largely useless if they cannot or will not be executed. This is true pretty much
regardless of profession or circumstance.

addresses a horror writer&amp;rsquo;s education in four articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>What You Are Meant to Know: Twenty-One Horror Classics&lt;/em>, Robert Weinberg&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weinberg&amp;rsquo;s message is pretty clear - know your genre. He suggests that, in order
to be marketable, you must be original. And, in order to be original, you must
know what&amp;rsquo;s already been done. Aside from the mechanics of writing, a horror
writer must be familiar with what&amp;rsquo;s been done. I think that&amp;rsquo;s great advice
regardless of genre, that in order to be creative - combine the usual in unusual
ways - you must first know what is usual. He lists out 21 books that every
horror writer should read. Sad to say, I&amp;rsquo;ve only read 6 and seen the movie
version of 4. I guess I have some reading to do&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“On Writing Horror” – Part One</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/01/on-writing-horror-part-one/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/10/01/on-writing-horror-part-one/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I&amp;rsquo;m starting my journal entries for &lt;em>On Writing Horror&lt;/em>, A Handbook by
&lt;a href="http://www.horror.org">The Horror Writer&amp;rsquo;s Association&lt;/a>. The book contains
about 50 individual articles, divided among 8 different sections, so I&amp;rsquo;m going
to match my entries up to the sections rather than address the articles
individually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part one is called &amp;ldquo;Horror, Literature, and Horror Literature&amp;rdquo;. The three
articles in this section seem to address whether Horror Fiction is or isn&amp;rsquo;t
Literary Fiction. Or more broadly, the contention between Genre Fiction and
Literary Fiction that seems to be pervasive, and has been for quite some time,
in the literary community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Urban Gothic” – No Signal</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/29/urban-gothic-no-signal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/29/urban-gothic-no-signal/</guid><description>&lt;p>Screenwriter John August has an interesting little post on
&lt;a href="http://johnaugust.com/archives/2009/no-signal">cell phones&lt;/a> in the movies. It
includes a great little montage of movie clips showing phones not working,
getting smashed, etc. Why on earth do I care?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brian Keene has this very problem in &lt;em>Urban Gothic&lt;/em>. In an era where it seems
everyone has a cell phone, how does a writer deal with it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By my count, there are six teenagers in Keene&amp;rsquo;s book, each of whom has their own
cell phone. They get trapped in an abandoned
(&lt;a href="https://www.davidlday.com/2009/09/28/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-the-haunted-house/">haunted&lt;/a>?)
house that&amp;rsquo;s in a bad neighborhood, but it&amp;rsquo;s a suburb of Camden, New Jersey. Not
exactly in the middle of nowhere. It&amp;rsquo;s actually well covered by AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon,
and Sprint. Yes, I checked, but not as any sort of petty criticism of Keene.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Urban Gothic” and The Minotaur</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/24/urban-gothic-and-the-minotaur/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2009 00:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/24/urban-gothic-and-the-minotaur/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.briankeene.com/">Brian Keene’s&lt;/a> recently released &lt;em>Urban Gothic&lt;/em>
brought to mind the myth of the Minotaur. A group of teens is thrown into a
labyrinthine house whose twists and turns extend far below the ground in a
neglected neighborhood. Their first encounter is with a hulking, deformed
creature whose strength seems insurmountable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keene tells this story from multiple points of view, and I think that worked
really well for the fast-paced action. I noticed, too, that Keene give the
reader an immediate indication of POV change by having the POV character
identified, in most cases, in the first sentence of any section change. I
noticed it because I was looking for it, but I don’t think it was in any way
repetitive or distracting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Stephen King&amp;#58; The Art of Darkness” - Night Journey</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/24/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-night-journey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2009 00:01:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/24/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-night-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>What is the “night journey” in the context of Stephen King?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, Winter shows how all of King’s works deal with some sort of journey. The
idea of story as a journey is not new. Joseph Campbell is well known for his
“Hero’s Journey”, and I’ve often encountered the aphorism that “the main
character must change” (which is essentially an internal journey - A to B).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I find most interesting is how Winter chooses to discuss the idea of
journey in King’s works. It is described initially as a journey from “East to
West”, and I covered this a little in my first post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Stephen King&amp;#58; The Art of Darkness” – Change of Approach</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/16/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-change-of-approach/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/16/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-change-of-approach/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m scrapping the chapter-by-chapter approach for my discussion on Douglas
Winter&amp;rsquo;s book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do a series of posts, each of which discusses what I
found to be the most critical and relevant elements in Winter&amp;rsquo;s analysis. Here&amp;rsquo;s
a list of topics I expect to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending no more than 30 minutes on
any given element to keep myself from rambling on.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &amp;ldquo;Night Journey&amp;rdquo; (East to West)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Haunted House&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Character growth from innocence to experience (tied to the &amp;ldquo;Night Journey&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The corruption of Fairy Tale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vision and the writing process&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In chapter 3, Winter begins his critical analysis of King&amp;rsquo;s work with &lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what I took from this chapter:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Winter considers &lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em> to be King&amp;rsquo;s most eccentric work. In part, it seems,
due to the epistolary structure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Right from the start, King&amp;rsquo;s trademarks of &amp;ldquo;unassuming prose and truthful
characterizations&amp;rdquo; are present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In King&amp;rsquo;s own words, he&amp;rsquo;ll go for terror, horror, and even the gross-out. Per
Winter, &lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em> &amp;ldquo;evokes the visceral, bringing the reader down to the guy
level at which King operates best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Winter quotes Peter Straub on the book: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;what was really striking about it
was that it moved like the mind itself. It was an unprecedentedly direct
style&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The book deals with the loneliness of one girl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is a fairy tale, a warped Cinderella story.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;The Cinderella imagery is made explicit when [Carrie] loses her slippers
fleeing the ball.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Carrie&amp;rsquo;s final act of destruction &amp;ldquo;is not revenge &amp;ndash; nor is it evil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Popular entertainment stereotypes children, but horror fiction often strives
for the inversion of innocence, &amp;ldquo;rendering children into agents of darkness
for no other reason than exploitation.&amp;rdquo; Winter cites &lt;em>The Exorcist&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The
Omen&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Carrie, the &amp;ldquo;evil lies not in Carrie White but in her tormentors &amp;ndash; and,
more important, in the traps of society and religious mania in which her
tormentors are confined.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Carrie White is, in Winter&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;the first of many King protagonists who
reflect his naturalist stance &amp;ndash; she starts nothing of her own free will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em> is a story about the coming of age, showing the romantic side of King
and his belief in the innate goodness of children.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The coming of age in &lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em> is a journey - east to west.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em> also provides social commentary through a pervasive feminist element.
&amp;ldquo;The blood imagery of &lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em> has sexual significance, not as an extension of
erotic power&amp;hellip;but of feminine power.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In contrast to the traditional fairy tale, where the heroine succeeds at her
trials and wins the kingdom, Carrie is pushed to the edge, left no alternative
but violence, and were it not for her &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo;, she would likely have failed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In King&amp;rsquo;s words: &amp;ldquo;The fundamental unfairness of naturalistic storytelling is
that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really admit for much optimism&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The final horror in the book is not Carrie&amp;rsquo;s. It is Susan Snell, &amp;ldquo;who must
live in the memory of blackness and its death song.&amp;rdquo; Susan Snell survives but
to what kind of life?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What I took from Winter&amp;rsquo;s analysis is King&amp;rsquo;s first published novel already sets
a pattern of naturalistic storytelling, of twisted fairy tales, and that the
idea of journey is fundamental to King&amp;rsquo;s work. King&amp;rsquo;s plain style and the
naturalism are a powerful combination.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Stephen King: The Art of Darkness” (Ch. 1-2)</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/29/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-ch-1-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/29/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-ch-1-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The next book in my reading journal is &amp;ldquo;Stephen King: The Art of Darkness&amp;rdquo;, by
Douglas E. Winter. Winter&amp;rsquo;s book is a critical look at King&amp;rsquo;s work up to the
mid-80&amp;rsquo;s mixed with biographical information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Chapter 1 - Introduction: Do the Dead Sing?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first chapter and introduction to the work poses the question, &amp;ldquo;Do the Dead
Sing?&amp;rdquo;. With that question, Winter brings us into the world of King by a broad
overview of some of King&amp;rsquo;s works, and an analysis of how they fit into and have
molded modern American Horror. Winter discusses some common elements found in
King&amp;rsquo;s fiction, using &amp;ldquo;The Reach&amp;rdquo; as an entry point:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“From Shadowed Places”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/23/from-shadowed-places/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/23/from-shadowed-places/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are two aspects of this piece I find as valuable models for a writer. The
first is the idea of death by inches. In my experience with horror, death come
as a relatively swift blow - maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some torture, definitely some pain,
but it is usually played out by a lot of tension and a quick end. Peter Lang has
been under severe torture for months by the time we enter the story, and it
shows through Matheson&amp;rsquo;s use of action, dialog, and description:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Person to Person”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/22/person-to-person/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/22/person-to-person/</guid><description>&lt;p>Dialog like this is a challenge. Matheson&amp;rsquo;s main character, David Millman, is
ultimately having a conversation with himself. He&amp;rsquo;s the crazy guy who hears
voices in his head. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a couple of pieces that have this happen in
them, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to pull them off so well (in my humble opinion).
Why is it that this story works but my own efforts haven&amp;rsquo;t?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s because when I&amp;rsquo;ve done it, my crazy main character sounds&amp;hellip; crazy.
I think one reason this piece is pulled off so well is that, through Millman&amp;rsquo;s
internal dialog, the reader is presented with several plausible alternatives to
him actually being crazy. The internal dialog is presented as a having a series
of explanations that all have the appearance of an external dialog - some
through technology, one as communication with the dead. All are direct dialogs -
person to person. So this internal dialog never gets old, as a fresh perspective
is presented with each new plausible explanation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“The Funeral”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/21/the-funeral/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/21/the-funeral/</guid><description>&lt;p>What I found most useful in this story is the sense of perspective, and how the
POV character needn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily be the main character. The story is told from
Morton Silkline&amp;rsquo;s perspective - the Director of a little cut-rate funeral home.
While the story is his, I would argue that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t really experience any
change and isn&amp;rsquo;t really the main character. It&amp;rsquo;s the vampire Ludwig Asper who is
looking for a change, and ultimately receives it in the form of the funeral he
never had.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Mad House”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/18/mad-house/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/18/mad-house/</guid><description>&lt;p>Matheson uses a great focus technique to bring the reader into this story. The
first four sections of &amp;ldquo;Mad House&amp;rdquo; are told in present tense, after which the
story switches to the usual past tense. These first four sections, which cover
only a few pages, are very special. They are tightly focused on the main
character and his anger problem. They are very action oriented, walking the
reader through several incidents of conflict between the main character and his
surroundings. We get no narration on who this guy is or why he&amp;rsquo;s so angry. We
get pure action and emotion. By the time the reader reaches the last section,
there&amp;rsquo;s a mountain of questions that have developed and drive the reader on
through the rest of the piece.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Dress of White Silk”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/15/dress-of-white-silk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/15/dress-of-white-silk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Telling a story from a child&amp;rsquo;s point of view is a challenge. Telling it in a
child&amp;rsquo;s language is a challenge as well. This piece was a little difficult for
me to get engaged with because of Matheson&amp;rsquo;s lack of punctuation and the poor
grammar (both intentional). This has the feel of an experimental piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that to be an effective writer at this sort of thing takes a lot of
practice. I kept thinking of Cormac McCarthy and his breaking of the rules. I
think the challenge put to the reader must be rewarded by the payoff, and in
this case, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the payoff was worth it. A good story, yes, but I think
it would have been just as effective told with more conventional grammar and
just using the child&amp;rsquo;s point of view.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Witch War”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/14/witch-war/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2009 00:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/14/witch-war/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why didn&amp;rsquo;t someone tell me there were so many vignette&amp;rsquo;s in &amp;ldquo;I Am Legend&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyhow, this little snippet is almost poetry. It&amp;rsquo;s a great collection of images
given in clear, if abrupt, language:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sky clearing its throat with thunder, picking and dropping long lightening
from immeasurable shoulders. Rain hushing the world, bowing the trees, pocking
earth. Square building, low, with one wall plastic.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s what really stands out to me here. Matheson&amp;rsquo;s use of imagery is
overpowering here, which is okay since there&amp;rsquo;s not much other than an intriguing
incident here. Not even a main character to speak of, nor a clear conflict other
than the generic conflict we find in any war. As a writer, the poetics of this
piece really appeal to me, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good example of how to work poetic
images into narrative.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Prey”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/14/prey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2009 00:01:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/14/prey/</guid><description>&lt;p>This vignette by Matheson gives an interesting parallel between a horrible
little Zuni fetish doll, and the power of a parent over their child. As a
reader, I enjoyed the chase and suspense of the woman being hunted by this
little hunter. It&amp;rsquo;s a cool little encounter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I found most valuable as a writer, though, is the phone conversation
between mother and daughter, as well as their family dynamic. Mother is
manipulative and demanding, and is preying on her daughter&amp;rsquo;s emotions. It felt a
little bizarre at first, having Matheson take us from this emotionally charged
interaction into this physically charged chase. But, I found myself hoping that
this little chase would give Amelia the strength (change her character) to stand
up to her mother and start taking control of her own life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Undead Blog</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/11/undead-blog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:04:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/11/undead-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve revived my blog.

&lt;p>I started a Master of Arts program in Writing Popular Fiction at Seton Hill
University at the end of June. Kismet - the first day of my first writer&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;p>Anyhow, part of the program involves reading (of course). And that requires a

To be honest, though, I didn&amp;rsquo;t
find anything particularly interesting from a writer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. The dialog
is plain, there&amp;rsquo;s little action, no real sense of tension, and the ending is
standard &amp;ldquo;Twilight Zone&amp;rdquo; material.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“I Am Legend” (Ch. 17 – 21)</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/11/i-am-legend-ch-17-21/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2009 00:02:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/11/i-am-legend-ch-17-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>These are the final chapters. Matheson does a great job of continuing to create
change in Neville. He&amp;rsquo;s encountered another human who is apparently immune as
well, Ruth. He&amp;rsquo;s cold and distrustful at first, now having been in isolation for
about 3 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He suddenly realized that he had become an ill-tempered and inveterate
bachelor again. He no longer thought about his wife, his child, his past life.

escalation. It&amp;rsquo;s brief story of an odd man who plays a game at the fair, the one
where you chuck ping-pong balls into a fishbowl, and never misses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The escalation is just that - the man never misses. It is, by nature of the
scene, repetitive, but it&amp;rsquo;s the repetition of the man&amp;rsquo;s success that builds the
story, bringing the reader along. Will he ever miss? Is he a shill? The carny
gets first annoyed, the suspicious, and finally upset as this stranger drops
ball after ball in the same fishbowl.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“I Am Legend” (Ch. 12 – 16)</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/09/i-am-legend-ch-12-16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/09/i-am-legend-ch-12-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here we find Neville hitting another brick wall. He thinks he&amp;rsquo;s figured out
what&amp;rsquo;s causing the vampires - a Bacilli (germ) - but he can&amp;rsquo;t attribute all the
vampire behaviors to it. So, what does he do? Well, by this point we know
Neville pretty well - a man who, although he&amp;rsquo;s survived some pretty extreme
circumstances, falls back to the drink when things get too challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Man, it&amp;rsquo;s time this guy get a new tune.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“I Am Legend” (Ch. 9 – 11)</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/07/i-am-legend-ch-9-11/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/07/i-am-legend-ch-9-11/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here we get more of Neville&amp;rsquo;s backstory, the death of his wife, his
determination to bury her instead of burn her, and the horror of her return as a
vampire. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, but what really interested me more in these chapters
is how Matheson shows us real change in Neville.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neville has continued sobering himself up, tackling his situation like a real
problem solver. He refers a few time to his father&amp;rsquo;s belief in the scientific
method as inspiration. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting character development, so see Neville
set upon the library, reading and learning everything he can, teaching himself
to use a microscope, learning to understand what he&amp;rsquo;s looking at, and ultimately
coming to the conclusion that this is a virus.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“I Am Legend” (Ch. 4 – 8)</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/06/i-am-legend-ch-4-8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/06/i-am-legend-ch-4-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Matheson turns Neville&amp;rsquo;s character around in these chapters. At the end of
chapter 4, Neville has forgotten to wind his watch and is stuck out after dark,
not even sure what time it is. He survives the attacks, and spends the next
couple of months rebuilding his home, getting to things he&amp;rsquo;d never done (like
soundproofing the walls). He then sets about trying to figure out what he can
about the virus or plague or whatever it is that&amp;rsquo;s caused all the people to
turn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“I Am Legend” (Ch. 1 – 3)</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/04/i-am-legend-chapt-1-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/04/i-am-legend-chapt-1-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Matheson&amp;rsquo;s first three chapters do something I always find very difficult to
pull off. He managed to develop a character in isolation, without having any
benefit of dialog with another character. The description and narration combine
well to bring out poor Robert Neville&amp;rsquo;s ordinary world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think Matheson also does a great job of building up the attackers through
their actions (and the one who constantly taunts - &amp;ldquo;Come out, Neville!&amp;rdquo;). He
makes it through two full chapters before referring to them outright as
&amp;ldquo;vampires&amp;rdquo;, giving the reader plenty of material to work with before falling
into stereotypes of the vampire. By the time we get to the explicit statement,
we as readers have been prepared for the idea that these may be vampires, but
they&amp;rsquo;re not Vampires.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Dance of the Dead”</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/03/dance-of-the-dead/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/07/03/dance-of-the-dead/</guid><description>&lt;p>Richard Matheson&amp;rsquo;s short story, &amp;ldquo;Dance of the Dead&amp;rdquo;, is a fine example of
matching up pacing and action. The story opens with four college kids racing
across the plains in a &amp;ldquo;Rotor-Motors Convertible, Model C, 1997&amp;rdquo;. The kids are
engaged in drinking, drugs, and sex as they head to Saint Louis to catch a
&amp;ldquo;loopy&amp;rdquo; show.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Needle quivering at 130, two 5-mph notches from the gauge&amp;rsquo;s end. A sudden dip!
Their young frames jolted and the thrown-up laughter of three was windswept
into night. Around a curve, darting up and down a hill, flashing across a
leveled plain &amp;ndash; an ebony bullet skimming the earth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“Stephen King&amp;#58; The Art of Darkness” – The Haunted House</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/28/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-the-haunted-house/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2009/09/28/stephen-king-the-art-of-darkness-the-haunted-house/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another element Winter discusses in his analysis of King is the haunted house.
What strikes me as most interesting with this is that, while I think Winter does
a good job of identifying the various &amp;lsquo;haunted houses&amp;rsquo; in King&amp;rsquo;s works, he never
seems to talk about what the idea of &amp;lsquo;setting as character&amp;rsquo; directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context, Winter identifies the following as noteworthy &amp;lsquo;haunted houses&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Martsen House in &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;Salem&amp;rsquo;s Lot&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Overlook Hotel in &lt;em>The Shining&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Agincourt Hotel in &lt;em>The Talisman&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Dark Tower in &lt;em>The Dark Tower&lt;/em> series *&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The last one is my own addition. At the time of Winter&amp;rsquo;s writing, The Dark Tower
was still in its infancy, with only the first book having been published. And,
as I look back over King&amp;rsquo;s works, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely other minor places
(settings) that would also qualify as &amp;lsquo;haunted houses&amp;rsquo;, but these four represent
to me the most important aspect.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
