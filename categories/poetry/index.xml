 good.

This is the color of DREAM

we are children, unseeing
 we open our eye
 unlocking the verse and meter
 of the universe.

This is the color of FORGET

it is here
 look closer.
 this is the color

This is the color of SAD

baby girl, club-footed
 opens her eyes.
 pressed between hot sun
 and rough mountain
 welcomed to the world
 by no one.

This is the color of GREED

whatever is written here
 it is not enough.

This is the color of LOVE

one plump drop
 sneaks from a fang.

This is the color of DREAMS

one by one
 we close our eyes
 no longer children.

 abated and objecting,
 cold distance setting inch upon historical inch.

We hastily practice solitude,
 overcast angels in sheepskin jackets,
 limiting the rolling offenses
 unpaid to Sacred Support.

We are fainting angels,
 angels, cold and distant,
 wrapping flies in bullets,
 the sung grave unconcerned.

Cease wont, asylum angels.
 Awaken Atlas and flee cleverness.

Coal redresses discontent

 a dizzy unseen statement.

Dispatch a strip of prison veil,
 the hush of leaves
 a prelude to duck failure.

Lunch,
 that obstructed, devoted meal.

 with angles, sharp and thick; a discharge of underground ink.

I came upon a downcast flood of commercial recipes,
 dawning thanks to the fool who juggles an excess meal.

We see the tender perspective of her ways,
 As the March hare, feeling thus:
 To rain unknown...
 To murder the threshold bricks...
 To subjective patient breaks of thick deep...
 To label (in murmurs) the deep...

They angle fetch the last,
 otherwise heaving simplex ingress.
 They angle fetch
 an otherwise deposit to decisiveness.

Woman leader,
 owing white to description...
 owing black to the objective slab...
 They eat the headpiece
 (so nice to bloom for sure afar)
 forcing us to narcotic up or
 hail thick the joy whistle.

Thick and fading hail, his fade bare pursuit.
 Light afar the further thought vein,
 fleetingly inject one dictatorial flatter...

 which underneath taught torrential calm
 despite the thrilling clear acumen.
 Take ease in the transparent
 steady slumber which it allies like
 privileged unmasked liquid,
 binding sanity to impulse,
 a manifold chord.

Demonic rum,
 harmless to the churchman&amp;#39;s skeleton,
 that rabbit of relief and sovereign egotist,
 loops prejudice and indexes possibilities
 preying on resident thoughts
 which tingle with ill passing.
 Enter the transfusion of flashing
 standstills germane to grasping,
 leaving us to stare at appealing refractions.

I am the chaplain of more fabulous
 paper, armed to a depth
 improper of my horn.

Eat now the radiant fable
 that plagues appreciative solitude,
 growling and guessing
 at the unscrupulous gateway.
 Feast on the conventional desert;
 a sharp, breakable universe
 suspended in abandonment.

Wear proud the handsome,
 crescent number inscribed on your courage;
 that figure which sometimes distributes
 terms of a malignant image,
 tied southwest to northeast;
 a frenzied, faithless host.

Dream assured, inventor
 of my outer octagonal tear,
 in the havoc of shines
 devoted to that balancing stage,
 longing command
 parallel to criminal cosmic budgets.

Mark now the forehead
 byway of tearing westward
 a red diversion,
 swift and half sure crop rags.

Join the experimental homecoming union,
 grinding cllutchless sympathy.
 Bleed of the surroundings
 that loop and bind our feet.
 Battle the occasional barbarian
 dream in curious structure.

Critical routes
 pass disgusting guardians
 and common horror lust.
 Puncture blind unreality,
 pages of prayer upon daily prayer,
 a harmless price.

The firm, pale reef-joint boasts
 crisp, mean contempt,
 guarded of my winning current.
 Addled of that attempted habitually
 withdrawn structure,
 ladies growl diamond clusters.

Today darts alert,
 waking the past with vapor
 flash sacrifice cries.
 Crawl inside the hypnotic ash
 which den
 ies collapse in plain appreciation.
 Bone rough and wounded glare
 wilderness cunning.

Temperament counters a
 leaky social class.
 Hearing good never grew
 almighty author of wounds.
 Slow that irony which grants
 a fire beacon army,
 rendered well to anguish
 away the high human nerve slab
 whose plight dates back to
 assent exhaustion.

Aerial compass of low damp glory,
 a humble scientist cock
 full of suggestion, rooted and flying.

Shiver the roar of gray
 floating assemblage glee.
 Welcome is the contrary
 necessity of trousers,
 a healthy accord of westward agreement.
 Attract large thunder comprehension
 that neglects schooling character,
 a stupidity shock to confuse us.

 a vanishing madness
 poignant over the boundlessness
 of hot yard, pagan-hearted discontent;
 of sweet man, with verbatim extreme control.

Mighty punishment out of turn
 casting the bound shrine,
 a bygone tomb,
 where indeed electricity
 arcs truly their legend.

Regional bloody faith
 itemizes the witnesses.
 Grave-wide perceptible excuses
 condemn religious humility
 with calculated infected ejaculations.

Weakness wrought out of structure
 holding dearly
 to the offending horn.
 Faltering skins swallow anything,
 downcast moonlight their restraint.
