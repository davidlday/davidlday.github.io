He pounds on my keys furiously, typing out insubstantial things, embedding himself in the abstract.
I creak and moan. I shout to him, &amp;ldquo;Go outside! Go play! It&amp;rsquo;s too nice to sit here all day!&amp;rdquo;
He doesn&amp;rsquo;t hear, just continues typing.
I shrug my shoulders.
I am Wednesday.</description></item><item><title>incense</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2007/05/21/incense/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2007/05/21/incense/</guid><description>fresh smoke squirms through our sacred window, pierces yesterday&amp;#39;s angel those words, salt your voice, awake my flesh, dried a raw monopoly of god</description></item><item><title>wet bug</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2007/05/12/wet-bug/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2007/05/12/wet-bug/</guid><description>squirming through the marbled world when you remember words remember the copper tang, the smoky perfume, the sad, warm woman your work must be porcelain steel rythms</description></item><item><title>translucent prisoner</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2007/05/09/translucent-prisoner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2007/05/09/translucent-prisoner/</guid><description>their wild steel universe surrounds him broken through sex, velvet worry - once live - now devoured color perhaps, sister, you listen - stiff lipped laugh, trembling explore them, pick and haunt, time stream pooling Original Images [ Achi Tryptichon ]

We hastily practice solitude, overcast angels in sheepskin jackets, limiting the rolling offenses unpaid to Sacred Support. We are fainting angels, angels, cold and distant, wrapping flies in bullets, the sung grave unconcerned. Cease wont, asylum angels. Awaken Atlas and flee cleverness.</description></item><item><title>Partial Meal</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/08/17/partial-meal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/08/17/partial-meal/</guid><description>Flesh-eating hearts nurtured on line-soup nurse ivory anguish that is bidden thirsty for us. Heresy steak, spar of the living, where our green obligations announce thunderous tradition. Coal redresses discontent implication, shudders resistance, a dizzy unseen statement. Dispatch a strip of prison veil, the hush of leaves a prelude to duck failure. Lunch, that obstructed, devoted meal.</description></item><item><title>RV dust</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/08/11/rv-dust/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/08/11/rv-dust/</guid><description>Hide desperation contained from wanting illusionary knowing life from memory As manifested sounds with soft chamber non-existence behold, my own wanting of another mirror reality</description></item><item><title>Mirror</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/07/24/mirror/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/07/24/mirror/</guid><description>Sublime ripples shadow purgatory wanting.

I came upon a downcast flood of commercial recipes, dawning thanks to the fool who juggles an excess meal. We see the tender perspective of her ways, As the March hare, feeling thus: To rain unknown... To murder the threshold bricks... To subjective patient breaks of thick deep... To label (in murmurs) the deep.</description></item><item><title>Tension</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/06/14/tension/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/06/14/tension/</guid><description>Apollo&amp;#39;s fissured time, muted and screened by circumstance.

Take ease in the transparent steady slumber which it allies like privileged unmasked liquid, binding sanity to impulse, a manifold chord. Demonic rum, harmless to the churchman&amp;#39;s skeleton, that rabbit of relief and sovereign egotist, loops prejudice and indexes possibilities preying on resident thoughts which tingle with ill passing. Enter the transfusion of flashing standstills germane to grasping, leaving us to stare at appealing refractions.</description></item><item><title>Abandon</title><link>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/06/05/abandon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://davidlday.github.io/posts-archive/2006/06/05/abandon/</guid><description>Mildly blamed abandon, a vanishing madness poignant over the boundlessness of hot yard, pagan-hearted discontent; of sweet man, with verbatim extreme control. Mighty punishment out of turn casting the bound shrine, a bygone tomb, where indeed electricity arcs truly their legend. Regional bloody faith itemizes the witnesses. Grave-wide perceptible excuses condemn religious humility with calculated infected ejaculations. Weakness wrought out of structure holding dearly to the offending horn. Faltering skins swallow anything, downcast moonlight their restraint.</description></item></channel></rss>
