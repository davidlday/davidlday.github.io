I love playing “what if”. I’m willing to believe more things before noon than most people do in their entire lifetimes.
Well, maybe not “believe”, but I’ll entertain any notion for at least a few minutes. Not because I need more beliefs in my life, but because it’s fun. So take this as me having fun, not me throwing a serious, fact-based, well-vetted idea out.</description></item></channel></rss>
