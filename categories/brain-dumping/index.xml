&lt;p>I love playing “what if”. I’m willing to believe more things before noon than
most people do in their entire lifetimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, maybe not “believe”, but I’ll entertain any notion for at least a few
minutes. Not because I need more beliefs in my life, but because it’s fun. So
take this as me having fun, not me throwing a serious, fact-based, well-vetted
idea out. If you think I’m wrong, I probably am.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
