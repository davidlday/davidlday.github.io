&lt;p>I love playing “what if”. I’m willing to believe more things before noon than
most people do in their entire lifetimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, maybe not “believe”, but I’ll entertain any notion for at least a few
minutes. Not because I need more beliefs in my life, but because it’s fun. So

This book served as my thesis novel for my
MA degree from Seton Hill. I graduated in 2011. The book was first published
in 2013.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I’ve been through plenty of changes. My boys have grown quite a bit,
my day job has changed several times, and I’ve spent a lot of time in therapy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is that last one important?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
