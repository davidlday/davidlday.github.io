My writing process sucks. I've written two novels, sold one, and I still don't know how the fuck I managed it. Probably a combination of luck, Jaegermeister, perseverance, and luck. Oh, and luck.

I need to get better at this. I can produce on demand when it comes to other things, difficult things, things I would never think twice about. Things that take combine art and craft, like writing code, architecting systems, and rebuilding a porch. And yet...

My writing process sucks.

** Define the Foundation **

Stuff like character sheets, settings, theme, etc

** Outline **

Self explanatory.

** Actually Writing **

* Action: Senses in a scene plus basic stage direction.
* Emotion: What do the characters feel?
* Dialogue: Clarify the voice of the characters
* Narration: Clarify the voice of the narrator(s) and POV characters outside of dialogue.
