Oct 9, 2009</div></div><article class="page-content p-2"><p>Part 5 of <em>On Writing Horror</em> is titled &ldquo;Horror, Art, Innovation, Excellence&rdquo;.
Five articles. Actually, 4 articles and one interesting interview with Harlan
Ellison.</p><p><strong>Innovation in Horror, <em>Jeanne Cavelos</em></strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m starting to see patterns of advice in these articles, even though they have
different emphasis. Cavelos talks in terms of innovation, but starts with the
foundational advice of read a lot, read both in and out of the genre. Doing so
helps the amateur writer avoid writing something that&rsquo;s old under the false
belief that they&rsquo;ve written something new. Fair enough, know what&rsquo;s been done
before so you can truly come up with something knew.</p><p>The crux of her article is that innovation in horror comes not necessarily from
creating something entirely new, but like so many other professions, innovation
is more readily achievable by combining old things in new ways. She then goes on
to talk about innovating in plot and innovating in style. She gives some good
fundamental advice and examples, which all ties back to &lsquo;combine old things in
new ways&rsquo;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s good advice, but nothing I wasn&rsquo;t already familiar with. I think popular
fiction has to balance the familiar and unfamiliar (literary, not subject
matter) to have a chance at commercial success.</p><p><strong>Depth of Field: Horror an Literary Fiction, <em>Nick Mamatas</em></strong></p><p>What&rsquo;s the difference between Horror and Literary Fiction? I don&rsquo;t think the
question makes sense, because like Mamatas, I don&rsquo;t believe the two are
diametrically oppossed. He provides an overview of the 3 main literary genres:
Literature (Classics), Realism, and Postmodernism. He also provides great
examples of horror in each.</p><p>Mamatas supplies some excellent reasons to strive for creating &rsquo;literary
horror&rsquo;: it sells, it gets reviewed, and it&rsquo;s significant. All are things I know
I strive for in my writing. I&rsquo;d also argue that horror as a genre is much more
narrow than need be. As emphasized in many of the other articles, at it&rsquo;s core,
horror is an emotion. While the genre is always aligned with Science Fiction and
Fantasy, I&rsquo;m more prone to consider it a close cousin to romance. It&rsquo;s about the
feeling of things, the deep emotional responses human beings can evoke and
invoke. Nothing about that is at odds with Literary Fiction, and in fact, taking
a literary approach is one of those things that might help a writer innovate in
terms of style. I love the way Mamatas sums up:</p><blockquote><p>Horror writers should consider changing their focus occasionally.
Characterization, artful language, and grammtical fancy-dancing, socially
relevant themes - stuff of literary fiction - are just as worthy of horror&rsquo;s
attention as blood and brand names.</p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with writing about yucky, scary, oozing stuff, and there&rsquo;s
nothing wrong about doing it in an artistic way at the same time.</p><p><strong>Splat Goes the Hero: Visceral Horror, <em>Jack Ketchum</em></strong></p><p><em>The Girl Next Door</em> is one of the most disturbing books I&rsquo;ve read in the past
few years. I absolutely loved it because it made me squirm the in uncomfortable
ways that I haven&rsquo;t experienced in a long time. This article helped me
understand why.</p><p>The book has nothing supernatural in it, no ghosts, no psychotic slashers. Most
of the characters are children - around ten years old or so, if I recall
correctly - with a few parent figures. It&rsquo;s primarily about abuse.</p><p>So, why did it make me squirm so much? Because, as Ketchum suggests in this
article, visceral horror is all about not looking away. In his book, the reader
isn&rsquo;t allowed to look away. He lays it all right out, raw and bleeding, with
nerves exposed.</p><p>Ketchum talks about pain in this article, and how to make it real for the
reader. He suggests a few points to help:</p><ul><li>Dress it up in everyday clothes. This goes back to what some of the other
articles have said. Keep things as close to normal as possible, so that the
juxtaposition of normal and abnormal are drastic.</li><li>Know all about the details. If things are inconsistent or just unrealistic,
the reader will know and get distracted.</li><li>Engage all the senses, and make sure the pain has the character&rsquo;s subjective
view to it. These are supposed to be human beings, make that humanity part of
the pain.</li><li>Make the reader care about the characters. Anything else is like reading the
obituary of someone you don&rsquo;t know.</li><li>Give meaning to the suffering. Ketchum thinks t the most fundamental level,
pain is about or involves loss. I completely agree. When violence happens, we
share in the pain best when we also share in the loss.</li></ul><p><strong>Darkness Absolute: The Standards of Excellence in Horror Fiction, <em>Douglas E.
Winter</em></strong></p><p>I like how Winter starts. He says there is no recipe for success, but there are
principles that provide guidance. Again, he repeats items found elsewhere, but I
think that&rsquo;s okay. I think it&rsquo;s more than okay, actually. The repetition is a
demonstration of the truth, and for all of these writers to say the same thing
should indicate that it&rsquo;s advice worth taking.</p><p>Winter offers the following principles:</p><ul><li>Originality is unachievable if all you do is imitate. Be familiar with the
genre, admire other authors, but don&rsquo;t try to write like them.</li><li>Originality cannot be taught. Is is something we each much discover.</li><li>Horror is an emotion, not a genre. Study across genres and look for horror in
other places.</li><li>Readers must have an emotional stake in the characters. Make the reader care.
Give the reader the characters&rsquo; perception.</li><li>Juxtaposition of normal and abnormal is much more effective when the normal,
or ordinary, is the more pervasive.</li><li>Everyday life may be mundane, but it is also the mystery at the core of
humanity. The fundamental questions we all ask have no answer. Likewise,
modern horror is not about the explanation. It is about the mystery itself.</li><li>Know the boundaries between good taste, bad taste, and taboo - not to stay in
one and out of the other, but to make the boundary crossing a conscious
decision. A good horror writer will cross the boundaries. (I like this one. I
like crossing boundaries and showing people what&rsquo;s on the other side.)</li><li>Concentrate not only on shock, or not on shock at all, but on the emotions.
Being suggestive can have more impact than being explicit.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to add social commentary or subtext to the story.</li><li>Be subversive. Conformity as salvation is a thing of the past, modern horror
sees conformity as &rsquo;the ultimate horror'.</li><li>Great horror is rarely about monsters. It is about us.</li><li>The ending must payout as well as payback. I think that means the ending must
survive the cynical sensibilities of the modern reader. It&rsquo;s not enough for
some neat and tidy solution to wrap things up any more. Endings can be messy.
I like what he says about the conclusion: &ldquo;&mldr;it is the vehicle by which the
reader is awakened from your nightmare and returned to his workaday world.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Writing horror is a forward-facing activity. We can build on foundations, but as
writer&rsquo;s we should be aware that horror lies not in the tropes, but in the
emotions those old tropes used to evoke. How do we go about invoking those
emotions in the modern-day reader? That&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;ll probably be asking
myself the rest of my life.</p><p><strong>On Horror: A Conversation With Harlan Ellison, <em>Richard Gilliam</em></strong></p><p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say on this. Ellison reinforces the idea that horror is not
a genre, it&rsquo;s an emotion. There&rsquo;s no conflict with writing horror and writing
literary fiction. Writers should be able to write more than one type of fiction.</p><p>To me, the most striking thing he says here is that the secret to writing is
staying a writer. That, to stay a writer, means to grow, be flexible, and
recognize when the world around you has changed so that you can change with it.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-3"><div class=sticky-sidebar></div></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-9 p-4"><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//davidlday.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></div></div><button class="p-2 px-3" onclick=topFunction() id=topScroll>
