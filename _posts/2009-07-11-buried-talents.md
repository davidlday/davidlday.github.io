This vignette by Richard Matheson presents an interesting technique for
escalation.  It's brief story of an odd man who plays a game at the
fair, the one where you chuck ping-pong balls into a fish bowl, and
never misses.

The escalation is just that - the man never misses.  It is, by nature of
the scene, repetitive, but it's the repetition of the man's success that
builds the story, bringing the reader along.  Will he ever miss?  Is he
a shill?  The carny gets first annoyed, the suspicious, and finally
upset as this stranger drops ball after ball in the same fish bowl.

As a writer, this story presents a fine example of escalation through
repetition.

As a reader, I'm left without answers.  But, such can be the nature of a
vignette.
