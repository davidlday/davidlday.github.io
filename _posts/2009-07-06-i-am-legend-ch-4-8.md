Matheson turns Neville's character around in these chapters. At the end
of chapter 4, Neville has forgotten to wind his watch and is stuck out
after dark, not even sure what time it is. He survives the attacks, and
spends the next couple of months rebuilding his home, getting to things
he'd never done (like soundproofing the walls). He then sets about
trying to figure out what he can about the virus or plague or whatever
it is that's caused all the people to turn.

So, back to the incident - the watch. Chapter 4 ends:

> He dragged the woman back to the station wagon and tossed her in. Then
> he closed the gate and took off the gloves. He held up the watch and
> looked at it. Three o'clock. Plenty of time to --
>
> He jerked the watch and held it against his ear, his heart suddenly

> The watch had stopped.

It seems like such a small, stupid, neglectful thing. When you're caught
in a post-apocalyptic world populated by vampires, you remember to get
home by dark. You remember to wind your watch. Normally, something like
this would irritate the hell out of me. Characters who do stupid things
like this feel like cardboard to me.

But, it works in this case. It absolutely works, I didn't hitch on it at
all. Why does it work?

Till this point, Neville has been spending his time in isolation, stuck
in a rut that includes blasting music at, sleeping poorly (if at all),
eating poorly, and drinking. A lot of drinking. While I still feel it's
a little contrived, I bought it.

So then we see Neville come around after his attacks. Why? He realizes:

> They were all in front of his house, waiting.
>
> A sound of helpless terror filled his throat. He didn't want to die.
> He might have thought about it, even contemplated it. But he didn't
> want to die. Not like *this*.

It wasn't bad enough yet for him. It's interesting to watch Neville's
scientific side come out after he gets back on his feet. He begins
methodically testing the vampire legends, trying to figure out why
garlic works, holding one hostage and demanding to know why she's afraid
of the cross, as well as trying to capture a memory that would give him
some inidication of what has happened.
