I just finished reading [Edward Lee](http://www.edwardleeonline.com/)'s
[*The Golem*](http://amzn.to/cjs1rX). This is my first encounter with
any of Edward Lee's work. I believe every author should have two
chances, so Ed Lee has one left. To me, the book read like a first
draft, but I'll get to that.

We don't see the golem used much in popular fiction. I can only recall
one instance where I've seen it used--an old episode of the X-Files
called [*Kaddish*](http://bit.ly/campOV). Lee brings the reader a modern
version of an old Jewish folk tale based on [Judah
Loew](http://bit.ly/bArhVJ), a 16th century rabbi who created a golem to
defend a Prague ghetto from anti-Semitic attacks. Lee brings the
folktale to life with vibrant rituals and an exploration of a dark sect
of Kabbalah based on Kischuph. The story revolves around the small town
of Lowensport, Maryland. In 1880, a group of Jewish refugees from
Prague,  led by the evil rabbi Gavriel Loew, construct two golems to
defend themselves from the attack of the Conner clan, a local group of
settlers lead by an ex-military deserter. The story is told in parallel
with the present-day tale of Seth Kohn and his girlfriend Judy, who move
into the old Lowen mansion and find themselves in the middle of a plan
by Gavriel's great-great-great grandson to resurrect Gavriel as a golem
and--you guessed it--take over the world, or at least small part of it.

I think the book presents an interesting bit of folklore, but aside from
that, I didn't find much appealing here. I don't know if this work is
representative of Mr. Lee's style (I'll have to read another to decide),
but I had difficulty in getting into the book because of the language.
The book is riddled with adverbs, which isn't necessarily a problem in
and of itself but Lee uses them to such an extent that I found myself
struggling to visualize much of anything in the book. For instance,
twice in the work Lee uses the word 'paranoically' to describe two
different characters.

> "Of course!" But then [Judy] looked paranoically behind her. (pg. 24)

And

> Czanek looked paranoically over his shoulder again. (pg. 52)

In both instances, Lee provides the action (the showing)--both
characters look over their shoulder. The reader sees what the characters
are doing and the context provides the tension. What does the word
'paranoically' bring to the reader? The reader is bumped from the story
with such an awkward word. These are two instances, but they are
representative of the work's style. I found myself jostled from the
story with almost every turn of the page. This is what made the book
feel like a first draft. I think the language could have been cleaned up
and more appropriate description put in to help draw the reader deep
into the story.

In addition to the language, I struggled with some key things Lee chose
to focus on in the story. The reader gets two pages describing the video
game Seth wrote and sold to make his millions, but the game itself has
very little to do with the storyline. The reader also gets a lot of time
spent on Switchgrass, the local cash crop, but again, other than
providing a setting for characters to hide in, the Switchgrass and its
use as a biofuel has little to do with the story. Whats more, the way
the reader finds out many of these details was bothersome. Judy, being
an ex-college professor, seems to know a bit about everything. Whenever
the reader needs an explanation, or even when the reader doesn't, Judy
pipes up to give details. Yet, when she's walking through the
Switchgrass, the reader gets a strange gap in her knowledge:

> *Watch for snakes*, she recalled the remarks of the man from the
> state. This new path was barely shoulder width. Did ticks live in
> switchgrass? No, she didn't think so. (pg. 194)

We get pages of infodump from this character, but when it comes to
something as trivial as ticks, she seems at a loss.

So, style aside, is there a good story here? It's interesting in terms
of the ritual and folklore of the golem, but I found myself struggling
to care about what happened to any of these characters.

First, the 1880 story centers around a group of black-magic Jewish
refugees (evil guys) locked in a struggle the Conner clan, with a group
of local settlers led by an ex-military deserter and his cohorts (evil).
I found neither side appealing, so I had no one to root for. Both sides
wind up wiping each other out, leaving a single golem. I found nothing
redeeming in the people on either side of this conflict. I initially had
some sympathy for the Jewish refugees until it became clear that they
were ousted by their own people in Prague because of their adherence to
Kischuph. So while there's some satisfaction in having a bunch of bad
guys kill each other, there's no one left at the end that I cared about.

The present-day story centers on Seth Kohn and his girlfriend Judy. Seth
is a game designer lost his wife two years earlier and struggled through
a bout of alcoholism. His girlfriend is an ex-college professor who
struggled with crack addiction. They met in rehab. But when the story
opens, both have recovered, Seth has made millions on his video game,
and they buy Seth's dream home near Lowensport, Maryland. These people
have everything, so I also had trouble sympathizing with either of them.
During the course of the story, Judy falls off the wagon and gets raped
several times by local drug dealers as part of the plot to recover
Gavriel Lowen's head from the mansion, but by the time this all happens
I, as a reader, have already disconnected from her as a character.

Compare these two with the main characters in [Nate
Kenyon](http://bit.ly/adTYC7)'s novel
[*Bloodstone*](http://amzn.to/dt9Ek6). Billy Smith is an ex-convict,
guilty of drunk driving and manslaughter. Billy is paired with Gloria
Johnson, a heroin addict and hooker. These are sympathetic characters at
low points in their lives, victims of circumstance to a degree. The
reader cares about Billy, who has done his time but still lives burdened
by the guilt of his crime. The reader cares about Gloria, a victim of
drug addiction who, at the start of the story, is near the end of her
rope. We cheer them on, we want them to get better.

Overall, I think The Golem provides little in the way of a good writing
or good story telling. But I have to admit, if this book is ever made
into a move, I will watch it. I think there are some visually stunning
scenes: the Kischuph ritual of golemancy, the dynamiting of the mill,
and of course the murderous mayhem inflicted by the golems. I have a
deep love for horror movies, and I'm much more forgiving of story in
exchange for the visual appeal.

I look forward to giving Lee's work another chance. If you have
suggestions of what is representative of Lee's writing, post a comment.
I'd love to hear from you!
