A great disaster. For a novel I started working on in October, 2006, I
started doing some research. There's a portion of it that takes place in
an old, abandoned city, one that had been left in destitution for
centuries, so I was looking around for theories on what happens to a
modern city when left to the forces of nature. To my shame, I had
forgotten about the Chernobyl disaster. In my research, I rediscovered
it.

There's an excellent site - an adventerous woman takes a motorcycle tour
of Chernobyl and surrounding areas, including Pripiat. See
[KIDDofSPEED](http://www.kiddofspeed.com/ "KIDDofSPEED"). It is
thought-provoking, saddening, and generally depressing. It provided the
example for which I was looking.

After reading the site, I began to wonder if some of the pictures she
had could be viewable on google maps. They were. Here are some
interesting comparisons.

Also, you can go to [wikimapia](http://www.wikimapia.com/ "WikiMapia")
and search for Chernobyl or Prypiat. There, people have outlined places
and you can get a little more infomation.
