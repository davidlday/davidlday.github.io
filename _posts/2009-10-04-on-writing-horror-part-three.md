Part 3 of *On Writing Horror* is titled "Developing Horror Concepts". 
It contains four articles dealing with conceiving and developing ideas
for horror.

***A World of Dark and Disturbing Ideas*, J. N. Williamson**

Williamson chooses to speak in terms of "useful premise" as opposed to
"idea", and I can appreciate his working definition.  Idea's are great,
but they are largely useless if they cannot or will not be executed. 
This is true pretty much regardless of profession or circumstance.  Per
Williamson, a "useful premise" is:

> a concept that (1) may be new or hasn't been developed into a plot for
> quite awhile, (2) the writer is comfortable with, and (3) for which,
> it can be reasonably assumed an accessible market exists.

Great working definition, and good advice.  Ideas are great, but if it's
not relatively unique, you're not comfortable with it, and there's no
certainty around marketing it, move on.

He moves on to talk about the ["Hypnagogic
State"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogic_state) as being an
essential resource of "useful premises" for him.  As I read, I thought
of a few things I'm familiar with - the concepts of [Lucid
Dreaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream) and the [Akashic
Records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records).  Williamson
seems essentially to be talking about dreaming with intention, or
staging yourself so that, when you fall asleep, you're able to tap into
the workings of your unconscious mind to work up your own "useful
premises".  Whatever the method or the terminology, I like what he's
talking about, and I try to utilize it myself.  It's a controlled
wandering of the mind, a release and freedom to explore that seems to be
an extremely difficult thing to accomplish in today's society - due to
constant, unfettered access (email, cell phone, instant messaging) and
increased demands for our time and attention by things other than
writing.  I think the crux of Williamson's article here is pretty much
that you have to make time for your craft, for your mind to work beyond
just "ideas" by being permitted to focus an idea into a "useful
premise".  We, as writers, have to make time to get in touch, and stay
in touch, with our creative side.

***Mirror, Mirror*, Wayne Allen Sallee**

Sallee's article addresses 'getting ideas'.  Personally, I didn't find
anything really new in here.  It's a decent summary of where a writer
can find ideas, though.  Essentially, he talks about finding ideas in
the circumstances that surround you (like news stories, etc), finding
characters by observing the people around you, and finding horrors by
introspection.

There were a few things he mentioned that I find interesting, though. 
In the section about introspection, he says that while terror may not be
new, there is the potential for a new angle by understanding different
behavioral traits.  I noted in the margins that "changes in
understanding and perspective on behavior provide a fresh look". 
Contemporary psychology provides an opportunity for redefining the old
tropes by allowing for different reasons and perspectives on
circumstances.

The other interesting piece in here that I hadn't considered comes in
his final section.  He suggests that the contemporary horror writer is
faced with greater challenge than ever because our readers are
constantly bombarded with horror in a way that wasn't possible in the
past.  This is incredibly important, I think, even though it's not about
how a writer finds ideas because it's critical in understanding which
ideas are 'useful'.  He further suggests that in spite of this,
successful writing must have characters (good or bad) with human traits
of affliction.  The humanity of our characters is what will help to bind
them to our readers and create the shared experience we all must drive
for.

***Going There: Strategies for Writing the Things that Scare You*,
Michael Marano**

One of the best ways to ensure you'll frighten your audience is by
writing about what frightens you.  I think Marano definitely has a valid
point here, but I think it's even broader.  It's about getting the
emotion into the writing in general.  If the writer believes in his own
work, feels the blood rushing through his veins, his temperature rise,
the cacophony and confusion that result from stress, it'll come through
in the work.

Marano poses a few ways of honing this ability.  One is the often cited
means of copying another writer's work.  The idea is that by going
through the process of actually writing out scenes that move you, you
learn how to write such scenes yourself.  This is pretty common advice
(at least it has been in my experience) - to become a master, start by
copying one.  I'm not really a fan of this.  I've tried it, and I always
wind up getting caught up in the mechanics of the process, like a
transcriber rather than a student.  It may work for some, but I've not
felt any great personal gain by this exercise.

Method Acting is another tactic he poses a possible route for getting
the emotion into it.  This is one I do draw on, but it's more of an
instinctive response rather than a planned out or focused activity.  I
find myself dropping down into my characters at tense moments and trying
to link their situation with some similar emotional situation in my own
past.  It's also something I find works best for me incorporated into my
writing process, not set aside as a precursor to writing.

The last method he discusses is one of my favorites - that of
surrounding important items with "negative space" or empty space.  This
is something I also experimented with in my poetry writings - the power
of what's left unsaid.  I find that some of my more best (most
fulfilling) writing often comes by giving incomplete descriptions, what
Marano calls "strategic glimpses".  There's a powerful psychology at
work underneath this tactic, one that serves to pull the reader in - the
idea of the [Gestalt
effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology).  In simplest
terms, it's the natural tendency of our minds to 'fill in the blanks'. 
By leaving strategic blanks, or divulging only glimpses of an image, you
force the reader into completing the picture with what is most
terrifying to them.

***Honest Lies and Darker Truths: History and Horror Fiction*, Richard
Gilliam**

I'm not all that interested in historical fiction, but there were some
items in Gilliam's article that I found interesting.  His article seems
mostly geared towards helping those interested in writing historical
fiction through understanding how to research and how to apply that
research.  I think the most interesting part of this article is
Gilliam's discussion on accuracy and relevance.  I can agree with him
that, it is the relevance of a story that makes historical fiction stand
out, as opposed to its historical accuracy.  This links back to the idea
of character.  If the characters in the story are both interesting and
relevant to the audience, then historical inaccuracy is likely to be
forgiven or ignored by most.

Gilliam also discusses a few forms of historical fiction - the "What-If"
story, and the "Parable".

He says the first is an underutilized form, and that there's two
possible problems with its use.  One possible problem is that the
premise is more interesting than the story.  The other, that the
subject's personality may conflict with the "what-if".  In the what-if,
there's a challenge of keeping an 'honest lie', keeping true to the
character's historical personality while changing the context.

The Parable is retelling a contemporary situation in a historical
context.  The prime example he offers, which most writer's are familiar
with, is that of *The Crucible* as a repesentation of the McCarthy
trials.

Interesting, but not all that relevant to me right now.  Why?  Well, his
next section on Gothic Horror sums up why I think it's in my best
interest to steer clear of historical fiction:

> Most commercially successful horror fiction has a contemporary
> setting.

I think my horror writing is best told in a contemporary setting, so I'm
going to stick with that for now.
