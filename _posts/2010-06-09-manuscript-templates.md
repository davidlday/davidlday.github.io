Part of being a professional writer is ensuring your submissions meet format
guidelines. [William Shunn](http://www.shunn.net/format/) developed a
set of format guidelines, originally published in December 1998 edition
of [Writers Write: The Internet Writing
Journal](http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/dec98/shunn.htm). He also
provides a set of [templates](http://www.shunn.net/format/wp.html) on
his site, but unfortunately they are only for WordPerfect. I use
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org).

I decided to create my own templates based on his guidelines and offer
them here for all to use. I emailed Mr. Shunn several times over the
past year to ask permission to post these, and never received a
response. I decided to go ahead and offer them anyhow, and if Mr. Shunn
objects, I will remove them.

Shunn has three format guidelines: Short Story, Novel, and Poem. While I
write poetry for my own amusement, I don't try to market it, so my
templates only include Short Story and Novel. If there's enough interest
in a Poem template, I'll add it.

Instructions

1.  Download the zip: [Shunn OpenOffice
    Templates](/assets/imported/2010/06/Shunn-OpenOffice-Templates.zip)
2.  Extract to any directory. You should see two files: "Shunn Novel
    Format.ott" and "Shunn Short Story Format.ott"
3.  In OpenOffice Writer, select **File \>\> Templates \>\> Organize**
    from the menu.
4.  In the left-hand pane, double-click "My Templates" from the list.
5.  On the right-hand side, select **Commands \>\> Import
    Templates...**.
6.  Browse to the extracted files and select one. It should now appear
    in the left-hand pane under "My Templates".
7.  Repeat steps 5 and 6, selecting the other file.

That's it! You should now be able create a new document by selecting
**File \>\> New \>\> Templates and Documents**. You should now have two
new templates listed!

I am also working on a set of templates for Microsoft Word since I
sometimes use it as well.
