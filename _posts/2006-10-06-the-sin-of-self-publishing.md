It seems to me that self-publishing has an awful reputation in the
literary community. I think the view is that if you're not good enough
to get picked up by a major magazine or publishing house, then you're
just not worth reading.

However, we see more and more in other arts that self-publishing and
promoting can break the industry barrier. And, in my opinion, the
independently funded and promoted works in many ways exceed the quality
of the mainstream channels.

Independent film making has taken off quite well in the past few years.
Decades, probably, but I honestly don't track the film industry. We also
see more and more in the music industry that new bands break into the
scene not by being 'discovered', but by making their art available and
letting the public decide. They create the demand, and then the industry
comes in later to pick them up and give them the deals they probably
should have been able to get from the first.

Blogging seems to be an equivilent in the writing industry. I think we
see now where more and more publishing houses are picking up popular
bloggers and either publishing compilations of their blogs or offering
them book deals. However, I don't see many bloggers spitting out works
of fiction or poetry.

I think it's time for the fiction and poetry writers of the world to
take those chances. There are printers who are more than happy to print
anything you can afford. There are also now more and more ways of
creating electronic versions of works.

So - my goal for now is to distribute as much of my work as possible. I
want it out in the public eye. And if it really is worth reading, then
it'll get around. If it's not, then I'll keep producing and trying to
make things that are worth reading.
