In part two of On Writing, King gives an overview of what he considers
the essential tools for every writer's toolbox.  The analogy is
interesting, and the story he provides at the start demonstrates an
excellent point: Always have all your tools with you so you can tackle
any unexpected situation.

So what goes in this metaphorical toolbox?

The first layer consists of common tools.  The most common tool, per
King, is vocabulary.  It's something we all have to varying degrees.  I
really appreciate King's take on vocabulary, which is essentially, learn
to use what you have and don't worry about developing more.  Your
vocabulary develops as a by-product of reading.  All writers are readers
first, right?

The other common tool is grammar, and it goes on the top along with
vocabulary.  He covers two fundamental issues in grammar: passive voice,
and use of adverbs.  These are pretty common topics in discussions of
grammar.  His reason for the mistakes really got me thinking.  He
attributes both mistakes to a form of fear.  For passive voice, King
thinks that timid writers use passive voice because it's safe and
because it lends some sort of authority to their writing.  Adverbs, on
the other hand, come from the writer's fear of being unclear.  King
believes that "fear is at the root of most bad writing."  Good writing
is about letting go of fear.

The second layer in the toolbox contains style.  Aside from the usual
reference book recommendation, King concentrates on the paragraph as a
good measure of style.  How the writer uses it to break up the page and
follow the beats of the story can show the difficulty of reading the
work.  Easy reading has short paragraphs and white space, hard reading
looks dense.  In fiction, the paragraph requires less structure than in
other writing.  He compares it to talking, and its use can be an act of
seducing the reader.  It's the music the writer hears in his/her head. 
He says that the paragraph is the basic unit of writing, and that to
learn it well is to learn the beat.

King also talks about commitment throughout this section, and how a
writer's first goal should be to help the reader out.  Words have
weight, they take a lot of work to put together, and can demand a lot
from a reader to digest.  In writing, we must be considerate and mindful
of the reader, always working towards clarity and  brevity, to keep the
reader from drowning in a sea of words.

King wraps up by talking about the third layer, which is to write real
fiction.  Stop the fear, build your works as a carpenter builds a house,
one brick or board at a time.  Build your writing with the basics, and
you can build whatever you like.

That's it for the toolbox.  I think King does an excellent job of
reminding us as writers just how far basic skills will take you.

Learn the basics, lose the fear.
