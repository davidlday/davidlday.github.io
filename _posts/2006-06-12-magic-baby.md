This one is actually my wife's idea.

This couple has this baby.  The baby is very in tune to his/her parents,
and it can pick up on what they wish for.  It begins granting their
wishes.  Sounds a little wierd, but I remember reading once that one of
the Native American tribes believes (or believed) that we are born with
knowledge of the language of the gods, and that we forget it as we grow
up, forgetting completely by age 4.  Interesting....
