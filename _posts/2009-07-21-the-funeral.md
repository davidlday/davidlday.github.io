What I found most useful in this story is the sense of perspective, and
how the POV character needn't necessarily be the main character.  The
story is told from Morton Silkline's perspective - the Director of a
little cut-rate funeral home.  While the story is his, I would argue
that he doesn't really experience any change and isn't really the main
character.  It's the vampire Ludwig Asper who is looking for a change,
and ultimately receives it in the form of the funeral he never had.

There's a good sense of humor in this story as well, a gather of undead
to give one of their own a proper burial.  I think Matheson does well at
portraying each of these individuals - a witch, a mad scientist, Ygor -
with their own personalities beyond the stock characters they're derived
from.  The brief interactions we see during the funeral get the reader
beyond the standard images.
