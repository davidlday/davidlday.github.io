Part 6 of *On Writing Horror* is titled "Tradition and Modern Times", a
series of articles covering horror tradition and its place in our modern
literature.

**No More Silver Mirrors: The Monster in Our Times, *Karen E. Taylor***

Taylor addresses how the old monsters can be made new again.  She's got
some good advice, and I'll get to that in a second, but there's
something she says early on that is direct opposition to what at least
one other author claims in this series of articles.  Taylor states:

> ...modern readers are more sophisticated than their parents and
> grandparents.  Today's readers also require *credible premises* and
> *explanations*; they want things to be *scientifically possible*.

I added the emphases.  Compare this to what Winter states in section 5:

> But today, *explanation*, whether supernatural or rational, is simply
> not the business of horror fiction.

Again, I added the emphasis.  Who's right?  What's going on here?  At
first blush, they do seem to contradict one another.  But, based on the
advice Taylor goes into, I think they are consistent with each other.  I
took Winter to mean that the modern story itself need not necessarily
address the reason for the events it contains.  To me, he's speaking to
whether or not the internals of the story must link to an external
reason.  Taylor, on the other hand, is speaking in terms of internal
consistency.

She first addresses the question of consistency and the rules of your
story.  She suggests that, unless you as the writer know the rules for
your 'monster', you cannot meet reader expectation and deliver a
believable story.  So, whether you start with a vampire or a werewolf,
you must first understand and commit to the rules of the trope.  And
then, you can decide which ones to break.  But, when you break the
rules, you must remain internally consistent.

The other two bits of advice she offers are to spend time in
characterization of your monster and to know your reader.  I don't
recall the first being addressed in any other articles, and it's good
advice for the modern horror writer.  It seems that a generalization of
the horror genre is the stupid, lumbering, unstoppable force of the
monster, a thing to be reckoned with rather than a person to interact
with.  She suggests taking the time to provide the reader with your
monster's point-of-view, and that by doing so, you can help the reader
better understand the internal and external processes that make this
monster a possibility.  Again, the explanation lies not in locating a
foundation in reality, but in creating an internally consist world where
that monster can and does exist.

The part about knowing your reader is common advice, but no less
important.  In the context of the article, Taylor is emphasizing that in
order to create and maintain the consistency while using the venerable
monsters of old, you must as a writer address the reader's
expectations.  You don't have to meet the expectation, but if you're
going to violate an expectation, you must create the internal
consistency that will help the reader accept your violation.

**Fresh Blood from Old Wounds: The Alchemist Meets the Biochemist,
*Joseph Curtin***

I personally did not get a lot from this article, I think primarily due
to its subject matter.  Curtin describes how the modern horror writer
can leverage current-day science to enhance or refresh old tropes.  He
cites how Dean Koontz refreshed *Frankenstein* in his series of books,
and how Michael Crichton refreshed *The Lost World* with *Jurassic
Park*.  These story achieved a freshness by enhancing the old story with
current scientific thought on how the 'monsters' could be produced.

He also talks about the modern social fear is in Biotechnology, and
relates that to the Cold War terror of the prior generation.

To me, this is an advocation of explaining the beast and tying it to an
external plausibility.  It's good advice, but for me, it's not
necessarily relevant.  My current interest and focus is in leveraging
myth as a basis for horror, not leveraging science.  If and when I
change focus, I'll be sure to come back and revisit this article to
prime myself.

**More Simply Human, *Tracy Knight***

Knight's article gives some great insight into characterization of
personality and mental disorders.  He cites some common errors in
representing these and a list of reference material that writer's can
use to validate or help ensure that they're portraying these things
accurately.  He also clearly states that he's not advocating the use of
mental disorder, but just wants to help make sure that it is done
accurately.

-   Aside from the reference material, Knight goes on to clear up a few
    common misconceptions.
-   Current psychotherapy goes well beyond Freud.  Know and make use of
    contemporary techniques.
-   Take care not to stereotype based on the reference material.  Not
    everyone has every symptom.
-   People who are unbalanced are, in fact, less likely to be
    unpredictable due to the nature of mental illness.  People with
    personality disorders are more rigid, predictable, and inflexible
    than the rest of us in terms of their perception and interactions.
-   The behavior of people with mental disorders is not without goals. 
    Every behavior has a goal, and they are coherent and consistent with
    how each of us views the world.
-   Everyone does what they believe to be their best.

Some of Knight's advice, particularly the last two, I think demonstrate
that people with mental or personality disorders are still human like
the rest of us.

**The Possibility of the Impossible, *Tom Piccirilli***

This is the first time I've ever really considered the close
relationship between horror and humor.  Piccirilli does a great job of
demonstrating how both derive from the surreal - the juxtaposition of
the normal and abnormal  Combining things in new and interesting ways
also provides the writer with the ability to create new and interesting
metaphors.  And that is foundational to all fiction, in my opinion. 
Like Taylor, Piccirilli also stresses the importance of internal logic
or consistency in creating the illusion.

**Take a Scalpel to Those Tropes, *W. D. Gagliani***

Gagliani rehashes the previously presented ideas of combining old things
in new ways to innovate and altering the rules for freshness.  What I
liked about this particular article is that Gagliani uses this short
piece as a practical demonstration through one of his own works. Nothing
new, but it serves to reinforce some very useful ideas.

**That Spectered Isle: Tradition, Sensibility, and Delivery Or Ghosts?
What Ghosts?, *Steven Savile***

While the premise of Savile's article is about the difference between
American and British horror, the real value to me is in getting yet
another perspective on horror without monsters.  He gives 2 resasons for
what he calls the "British Sensility":

Britain has a long history and rich heritage that is filled with ghost
stories.

Brain has a heritage of "withstanding atrocities with that stubborn
stiff upper lip".

What he lead to is that the most frightening things to the British
audience are those that can't be seen.  So, the most frightening things
are those based on internals - social ills, ghosts, stuff that can't be
seen.  I think what he is driving at is that there's tremendous value
for the modern horror author in working with things less tangible than
the old vampires and werewolves.   I wasn't really getting a point from
him until he brought up Easton Ellis's *American Psycho*.  It works so
well because it drives the reader into the head of a madman.  Aside from
the gruesome acts of the main character, being inside his head adds an
element of horror beyond.

**New Horrors: A Roundtable Discussion of Horror Today and Tomorrow,
*Joe Nassise (moderator)***

I don't have much to say on this.  All four authors (Pat Tremblay, Gary
Frank, Melinda Thielbar, Nate Kenyon) provide some good advice.  But
it's short, so none of them really have the opportunity to delve into
any one subject.  It's definitely a good read for new authors, as you
can see that even here, not all authors play by the same rules or focus
on the same things.  Here are the questions posed to the group:

-   What are the three most important skills a new writer should have?
-   What three pieces of advice to new writers do you not agree with?
-   What's different about the publishing industry today than when you
    started?  What'll happen over the next couple of years?
-   What's the value of horror to the literary community?

Like I said, interesting questions and a variety of answers (sometime
contradicting one another), but nothing that I felt helped me out.
