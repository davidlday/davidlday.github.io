An old man, used up by his years of corporate loyalty. He has spent each
evening leaving work late, stopping by a fountain, tossing a coin in. No
wishes, no prayers, just a donation. Now, his retirement eve,the end of
an uneventful day with the obligatory cake and cards, he stops at the
fountain one last time. It is later than usual, nearly midnight, and he
is alone by the fountain.

A young man joins him, both sitting by the fountain, and makes him an
offer. A reset button, but will not disclose the price. The man takes
it, and it is again his first day on the job.
