The last section of "On Writing Horror" is all about the business aspect
of being a writer.  It provides a nice overview of the current markets,
good resources for research and promotion, and some worthwhile advice
from editors and writers alike.

Here's the advice I'm taking right now, given by *Night Shade Books*:

> Write what you think is your best book.  Put it in a trunk and write
> another one.  Do this four times.  Then start sending your novels out
> for submission.

So, while it's never to early to build awareness about the market, right
now I'm focusing on building my writing skills.  If there's nothing to
sell, there's nothing to market.

Oh, and the afterword by Harlan Ellison - quite cool.

I'm done with this book, moving on to the next.
