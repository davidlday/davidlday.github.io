I was
overweight, out of shape, but my oldest minion had been taking classes for a
year plus and had just turned old enough to start doing family classes. So I
buckled down, drank plenty of water, tried not to smoke so much and gave it a
shot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t just show up to class with him one day, though. The last thing I wanted
was for my son to see his old man collapse in a fit of coughing or pass out from
exhaustion or wind up twisting himself into so many Gordian knots even the EMTs
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to save him. I took adult classes for a few months to get a
bead on where I really stood physically. Turned out I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in all that bad of
shape. Also, apparently very few folks actually went to the adult classes, so I
wound up getting a bunch of private lessons at regular cost and getting to know
the masters pretty well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
