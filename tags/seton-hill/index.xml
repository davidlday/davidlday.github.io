The anthology was compiled in support of Donna Munro, an 2004 graduate of the program. Find out more details at the HYF website, and check out the Amazon page. There was a lot of buzz on Facebook and Twitter (still going even this morning, I believe), and the anthology quickly rose among Amazonâ€™s Hot New Releases to crest at #1 in Short Story Anthologies yesterday afternoon.</description></item></channel></rss>
