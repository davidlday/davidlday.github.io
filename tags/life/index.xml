I have a picture of you from 1971.
You are dressed in a white sleeveless top and matching white stockings kneeling next to a tree. Nestled in your arms is a small, white bundle with a tuft of dark hair. Your face is turned down, but not so much that your proud, slight smile is hidden.</description></item><item><title>Saying Goodbye to Our Dog</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2016/03/26/goodbye-zoe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2016/03/26/goodbye-zoe/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Until one has loved an animal, a part of one&amp;rsquo;s soul remains unawakened.&amp;rdquo;

We incrementally changed our lives to accommodate our aging dog Zoe, which was at times frustrating for all of us, but never burden.</description></item></channel></rss>
