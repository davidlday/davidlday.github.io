&lt;p>“Our memory is a more perfect world than the universe: it gives back life to
those who no longer exist.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ Guy de Maupassant&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I have a picture of you from 1971.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are dressed in a white sleeveless top and matching white stockings kneeling
next to a tree. Nestled in your arms is a small, white bundle with a tuft of
dark hair. Your face is turned down, but not so much that your proud, slight
smile is hidden.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saying Goodbye to Our Dog</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2016/03/26/goodbye-zoe/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2016/03/26/goodbye-zoe/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Until one has loved an animal, a part of one&amp;rsquo;s soul remains unawakened.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ Anatole France&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Our kitchen table is back in the kitchen. The screen door on our back porch
stays closed. I don&amp;rsquo;t scurry downstairs to turn off the alarm in the wee hours
of the morning. Things are back to normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except they aren&amp;rsquo;t. They never will be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We incrementally changed our lives to accommodate our aging dog Zoe, which was
at times frustrating for all of us, but never burden. She was such an integral
part of our family, and deeply seated in our hearts. She passed away March
17, 2016. She was 14 years old.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
