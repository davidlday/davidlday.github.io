My
current project—a novel that’s probably too complex, but fun to write—stalled
and I couldn’t find a way back into the story. I needed to put the word
processor aside and revisit the fundamental structure of the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also mentioned in that post how I like to use index cards for planning my DIY
projects around the house. (By the way, the closet organizer we were working on
only needs a couple of coats of polyurethane and we’re done!) Index cards are
relatively portable, they constrain and force me to think about what I need to
capture, and I can easily rearrange them to change the structure of whatever I’m
working on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
