I have a few different reasons, but the biggest is that frankly I don’t think my personal experiment is all that interesting. I’m still interested, but I can’t get all that excited about it. My sleep data goes back to the middle of July, and what I noticed is that even when I sleep in, I usually only sleep about six hours.</description></item><item><title>Sleeping Like an Idiot: Week 7 - Charts!</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/09/24/sleeping-like-an-idiot-week-7-charts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2012 03:33:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/09/24/sleeping-like-an-idiot-week-7-charts/</guid><description>I managed to pull together four charts to help demonstrate progress. I took a cue from The Hacker’s Diet and used a 20-Day moving average to get trends. In each chart the actual measure is in blue and the trend is in orange. For now I just used a Simple Moving Average since the charts are just to get a sense of how things are going and aren’t meant to give highly accurate measures.</description></item><item><title>Sleep Experiment: Week 6</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/09/18/sleep-experiment-week-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 07:28:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/09/18/sleep-experiment-week-6/</guid><description>I’m a couple of days behind in putting this up, mainly because I was hoping to get some charts put together from my Zeo. The charts provided through its software are nice, but they’re not really showing what I want, so I have a little bit of work to do still.
Remember, I’m doing an Everyman sleep schedule, which involves a major sleep event at night and multiple naps during the day.</description></item><item><title>Reintroducing the Sleep Experiment: 5 Weeks @ 5 Hours a Night</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/09/09/reintroducing-the-sleep-experiment-5-weeks-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2012 08:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/09/09/reintroducing-the-sleep-experiment-5-weeks-5/</guid><description>About five weeks ago I posted about the sleep experiment I was undertaking. I haven’t been as diligent as I would like in recording results via blog, so I’m going to do some catching up here and make the effort more frequently.
Yesterday I caught up on the progress of Handy Andy Pandy—this dude’s an inspiration for me. I also reread my [first post]({% post_url 2012-07-21-a-writers-experiment-with-sleep %}) and realized it didn’t actually share details on what I’m doing very well.</description></item><item><title>A Writer's Experiment with Sleep</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/07/21/a-writers-experiment-with-sleep/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jul 2012 16:56:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/07/21/a-writers-experiment-with-sleep/</guid><description>Last week I started a new experiment in writing, one that I hope will both boost productivity and creativity. It’s not your typical experiment, though. I’m not going to stand on my head while I write, or use prompt cards, or any other fancy tools I don’t already use. I’m going to change something much more fundamental about my writing habit. I’m changing my sleep. Okay, not so exciting, but I think it’s a promising approach.</description></item></channel></rss>
