I
haven’t been as diligent as I would like in recording results via blog, so I’m
going to do some catching up here and make the effort more frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday I caught up on the progress of
&lt;a href="http://handyandypandy.com/polyphasic-sleep/">Handy Andy Pandy&lt;/a>—this dude’s an
inspiration for me. I also reread my [first
post]({% post_url 2012-07-21-a-writers-experiment-with-sleep %}) and realized it
didn’t actually share details on what I’m doing very well. I’m betting I was
still pretty foggy from my new sleep schedule.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Book Reviews Suck And How We Can Fix Them</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/08/31/why-book-reviews-suck-and-how-we-can-fix-them/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2012 06:30:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/08/31/why-book-reviews-suck-and-how-we-can-fix-them/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disclaimer&lt;/strong>: This post comes from me as a technologist and a reader, not as a

lack of disclosure on using the service prompted me to finally put up a post on
something I’ve been thinking about for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paying someone to review your book is like asking your mom what she thought of

of stories by seventy-six writers connected to the Seton Hill University Writing
Popular Fiction program. The anthology was compiled in support of Donna Munro,
an 2004 graduate of the program. Find out more details at the HYF website, and
check out the Amazon page. There was a lot of buzz on Facebook and Twitter
(still going even this morning, I believe), and the anthology quickly rose among
Amazon’s Hot New Releases to crest at #1 in Short Story Anthologies yesterday
afternoon.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
