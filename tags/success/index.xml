the positive things in my life, this was a complete accident. My last cigarrette
was on December 31, 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve even kept the pack, which is still half full. I
don&amp;rsquo;t give it a second thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love nicotine almost as much as I love caffeine. I&amp;rsquo;m something of a stimulant
junkie (as much as the law will allow) I think in part because my natural state
of being is so low key and laid back that I&amp;rsquo;m something like half-a-step behind
the rest of the world, out of phase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Succeed as a Writer</title><link>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/08/10/how-to-succeed-as-a-writer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2012 06:45:51 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.davidlday.com/posts-archive/2012/08/10/how-to-succeed-as-a-writer/</guid><description>&lt;p>A couple of days ago, Jeff VanderMeer posted an articulate and insightful piece
&lt;a href="http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2012/08/06/dreaming-well-does-the-future-of-publishing-need-more-imagination/">on the future of publishing&lt;/a>.
It’s not typical among the current flood of posts and opinions about where we’re
going or what the next hot thing is. Rather, Jeff gets to the heart of what he
believes to be a real problem today with the advice and predictions being touted
in the writing community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go read his
&lt;a href="http://www.jeffvandermeer.com/2012/08/06/dreaming-well-does-the-future-of-publishing-need-more-imagination/">post&lt;/a>
