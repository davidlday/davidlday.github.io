My last cigarrette was on December 31, 2015. I&amp;rsquo;ve even kept the pack, which is still half full. I don&amp;rsquo;t give it a second thought.
I love nicotine almost as much as I love caffeine. I&amp;rsquo;m something of a stimulant junkie (as much as the law will allow) I think in part because my natural state of being is so low key and laid back that I&amp;rsquo;m something like half-a-step behind the rest of the world, out of phase.</description></item></channel></rss>
