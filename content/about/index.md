I write dark fantasy, often with a heavy helping of religious symbolism. I hold
a BA in English, Creative Writing, and an MBA from Ohio University. I'm also a
graduate of the
[Master of Arts in Writing Popular Fiction](http://www.setonhill.edu/academics/fiction/index.cfm)
program at Seton Hill University (now an MFA program).

I like scary movies. My older brother and I used to watch
[Fritz the Night Owl](http://www.fritzlives.com/)'s Double Chiller Theater every
Friday night. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever discovered.

I also read a lot as a kid, spending hours on end at the library reading
anything dark and sticky, like candy for the brain. Now I'm all grown up,
married to a lovely wife, and father to two awesome sons. Between family,
writing, and the day job I keep pretty busy. But I still make time for books and
the occasional B movie.

My favorite quote of all time:

> When forced to work within a strict framework, the imagination is taxed to its
> utmostâ€¦ and will produce its richest ideas. Given total freedom, the work is
> likely to sprawl.

> - T. S. Eliot
