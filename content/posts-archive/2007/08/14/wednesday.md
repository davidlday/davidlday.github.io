I hum and beep at my master, but he does not listen. He pounds on my keys
furiously, typing out insubstantial things, embedding himself in the abstract.

I creak and moan. I shout to him, "Go outside! Go play! It's too nice to sit
here all day!"

He doesn't hear, just continues typing.

I shrug my shoulders.

I am Wednesday.
