```poem
you sense my hesitation.
    good.

This is the color of DREAM

we are children, unseeing
    we open our eye
    unlocking the verse and meter
    of the universe.

This is the color of FORGET

it is here
    look closer.
    this is the color

This is the color of SAD

baby girl, club-footed
    opens her eyes.
    pressed between hot sun
    and rough mountain
    welcomed to the world
    by no one.

This is the color of GREED

whatever is written here
    it is not enough.

This is the color of LOVE

one plump drop
    sneaks from a fang.

This is the color of DREAMS

one by one
    we close our eyes
    no longer children.
```
