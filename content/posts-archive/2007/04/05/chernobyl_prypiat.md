A great disaster. For a novel I started working on in October 2006, I started
doing some research. There's a portion of it that takes place in an old,
abandoned city, one that had been left in destitution for centuries, so I was
looking around for theories on what happens to a modern city when left to the
forces of nature. To my shame, I had forgotten about the Chernobyl disaster. In
my research, I rediscovered it.

There's an excellent site - an adventurous woman takes a motorcycle tour of
Chernobyl and surrounding areas, including Pripyat. See
[KIDDofSPEED](http://www.kiddofspeed.com/ "KIDDofSPEED"). It is
thought-provoking, saddening, and generally depressing. It provided the example
for which I was looking.

After reading the site, I began to wonder if some of the pictures she had could
be viewable on Google Maps. They were. Here are some interesting comparisons.

Also, you can go to [wikimapia](http://www.wikimapia.com/ "WikiMapia") and
search for Chernobyl or Pripyat. There, people have outlined places, and you can
get a little more information.
