Part 4 of _On Writing Horror_ is titled "Horror Crafting", and encompasses 7
articles on the craft. So many articles, and much of it is advice I've heard
before, so I'm going to keep this as short as I can.

**_Such Horrible People_, Tina Jens**

Per Jens, "Horror is about how people react _when they encounter_ the plot." So
to have good horror, we need good characters who interact with the plot. That's
nothing new to me, and it's sound advice.

Jens goes on to talk about balancing out developing plot and character,
describing an initial process where you (the writer) might start with and idea,
find characters to put in, jump back to plot to find the "monster's" goal, who's
the monster up against, etc. Then she says that, after some initial back and
forth, it's time to stop with the plotting and get to know your characters.

She outlines several things writer's can do to develop their characters:
starting with people you know, working with picture files, developing
full-fledged character sketches. She does a good job of covering these, a good
introductory source for those interested.

She continues on to say the payoff in doing all this seemingly unnecessary work
is that now you have created characters that you can trust to help you develop
the plot by interacting and reacting rather than just following orders. Or
something along those lines. She sums the concept up well, "Listen to your
characters. It pays off."

Again, a definite plus, but also pretty common advice (at least to me). But I
think there's something much more important here than just, "knowing and
trusting your characters".

Building an awareness and a trust in your characters is a misnomer. They're not
real. What this process really does is help the writer develop an awareness and
trust in themselves, and tune the skills of imagine characters _in toto_, so
that as the plot develops, the writer isn't constantly second guessing or making
inconsistent decisions.

Let's take the question of, "What would my character have for breakfast?" Sure,
who cares, but stay with me a moment. The writer who has to stop and consider
this while plotting needs to refine their skills on character by utilizing
processes such as Jens describes. But, the goal is not to produce mountains of
character sketches and character data that will never be incorporated into the
story. The goal is to use the process to develop those skills internally, so
that the next question that comes up can be answered with confidence and
consistency. We all have weak spots, so some writers may have to do character
sketches the rest of their careers, but that's okay. Just as long as they keep
sight of the point - build trust and confidence in your knowledge of the
characters.

**_A Hand on the Shoulder_, Joe R. Lansdale**

Lansdale's article is primarily about environment. He raises an interesting
perspective on the writer's connection to his or her environment, and how to
benefit from it. I think his main thrust is something I've only recently come to
recognize. I've always been tempted to set my stories in exotic places with
strange characters. Who isn't? But, there's an incredible benefit to using
what's around me everyday in my stories. It creates a sense of honesty in the
lie.

My environment is a part of who I am and what I know. If I use it (the familiar
settings and characters) as fundamental elements in my writing, then it shows
through in both confidence and style. Plus, when I do break from those and delve
into the 'unusual', it has greater impact. The normal aspects of my writing
become more believable because they are real things, not imagined. There's no
need to dream up the real world when it's right in front of us. Save the
creative efforts for those things that aren't real (we hope...)

**_Eerie Events and Horrible Happenings: Plotting Short Horror Fiction_,
Nicholas Kaufmann**

I didn't find much personal value in Kaufmann's article because it's concerned
with short fiction. I'm currently working on novel related skills, and I've also
been working with short stories for a few years now.

That's not to say there's no value in the article. It's does a good job of
covering the fundamentals of short horror fiction. Some of the basics covered:

- Start close to the action.
- Every scene should be related to the plot
- The main character must either have the most to lose or the most to gain
- Short stories usually stick to one conflict
- The end must tie directly to the main conflict

Definitely one I'll use to refresh myself when I tackle my next short story.

**_Reality and the Waking Nightmare: Setting and Character in Horror Fiction_,
Mort Castle**

Castle's article carries a message similar to Lansdale's. Save the imagination
for the places it really matters. Good fiction must be credible, and the best
way to achieve that is to keep as close to the truth as possible when it comes
to setting and character. Two quotes sum this up:

> ...readers are familiar with the ordinary; they live there. Readers relate to
> the ordinary...

and

> When the ordinary is invaded by the terrifyingly extraordinary, horror
> happens.

I like that last one, and I'm striving to keep it close to the heart. In a world
where everything is fantastic, everyone is a monster or a superhero, then the
writer has to work extra hard to bring in anything with shock value. But, if we
keep things as close to normal as possible, then shocking the reader should come
more easily.

**_"He Said?" She Asked: Some Thoughts About Dialog_, David Morrell**

Dialog has and is one of my toughest challenges. At least it's where I've been
spending most of my focus lately. The advice found in here is an invaluable
listing of the fundamentals of dialog. Morrell addresses the following common
problems in dialog:

- Use of tags - Stick to the basics: said, asked, and a few others.
- Use of adverbs - DON'T
- Use of punctuation - Stick to periods and question marks. Emphasize through
  action or description, not tags or exclamation marks.
- Colloquialisms - Extreme moderation
- Sloppy Diction via misspelled words - Again, Extreme moderation

Worth the read for anyone just getting into dialog challenges.

**_Keep It Moving, Maniacs: Writing Action Scenes in Horror Fiction_, Jay R.
Bonansinga**

Writing action is like writing poetry. While Bonansinga doesn't say this
directly, I think it's a fair way to sum up the first part of his article. The
point is to get the language to match the action. Fundamentally, it's about
rhythm, establishing it and getting it to change along with the action of the
scene. Bonansinga describes various techniques that include moving from terse
sentences to more free-form, abrubt insertion of all caps, and alliteration.

The other considerations he covers are:

- Presenting through a character - action should be shown subjectively to
  provide emotional as well as physical response.
- Engaging the environment - having the character interact with the environment
  to enhance action.
- Details - make use of the human tendency to fixate on details during violent
  events.
- Time - make time compress and expand to bring focus in on the action and
  expedite periods of inactivity.

I really appreciate his final words on the subject:

> That's what action is.
>
> A human being in peril - forced to _perceive_.

**_The Dark Enchantment of Style_, Bruce Holland Rogers**

Rogers reiterates what I think is pretty common advice on the subject of style.
Read, analyze and practice. But, there are two new perspectives he presents that
I think are invaluable.

I struggle with style constantly, but I've never been certain why. Style has
always been something an author has in my mind, and Rogers says flat out that
this is wrong. In fact, he says that finding your voice is inappropriate advice.
The trick is, and I agree, to find the voice for each story. That voice may, and
likely will, be different. Yes, a writer may have a particular style that shines
through every work, but I agree with Rogers when he says:

> The voice, rather, is one that is just right for telling a particular kind of
> tale.

and

> A good writer suites the telling to the tale.

The other piece of advice he gives is to slow down in both reading and writing.
It's a process he's suggesting, one that will serve to make the writer more
aware of language, and that certainly can't hurt.
