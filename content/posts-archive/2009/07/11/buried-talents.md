This vignette by Richard Matheson presents an interesting technique for
escalation. It's brief story of an odd man who plays a game at the fair, the one
where you chuck ping-pong balls into a fishbowl, and never misses.

The escalation is just that - the man never misses. It is, by nature of the
scene, repetitive, but it's the repetition of the man's success that builds the
story, bringing the reader along. Will he ever miss? Is he a shill? The carny
gets first annoyed, the suspicious, and finally upset as this stranger drops
ball after ball in the same fishbowl.

As a writer, this story presents a fine example of escalation through
repetition.

As a reader, I'm left without answers. But, such can be the nature of a
vignette.
