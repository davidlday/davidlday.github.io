I've revived my blog. It's been dead for about a year. Poor blog.

I started a Master of Arts program in Writing Popular Fiction at Seton Hill
University at the end of June. Kismet - the first day of my first writer's
residency was also my birthday.

Anyhow, part of the program involves reading (of course). And that requires a
reading journal. Perfect use for a blog.

Welcome back, poor little neglected blog. Welcome back.
