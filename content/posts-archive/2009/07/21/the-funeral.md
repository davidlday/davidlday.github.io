What I found most useful in this story is the sense of perspective, and how the
POV character needn't necessarily be the main character. The story is told from
Morton Silkline's perspective - the Director of a little cut-rate funeral home.
While the story is his, I would argue that he doesn't really experience any
change and isn't really the main character. It's the vampire Ludwig Asper who is
looking for a change, and ultimately receives it in the form of the funeral he
never had.

There's a good sense of humor in this story as well, a gather of undead to give
one of their own a proper burial. I think Matheson does well at portraying each
of these individuals - a witch, a mad scientist, Ygor - with their own
personalities beyond the stock characters they're derived from. The brief
interactions we see during the funeral get the reader beyond the standard
images.
