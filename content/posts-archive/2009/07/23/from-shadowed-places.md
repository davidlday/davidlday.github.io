There are two aspects of this piece I find as valuable models for a writer. The
first is the idea of death by inches. In my experience with horror, death come
as a relatively swift blow - maybe there's some torture, definitely some pain,
but it is usually played out by a lot of tension and a quick end. Peter Lang has
been under severe torture for months by the time we enter the story, and it
shows through Matheson's use of action, dialog, and description:

> The sight made Jennings gasp. If ever a face could be described as tortured,
> it was Lang's. Darkly bearded, bloodless, stark-eyed, it was the face of a man
> enduring inexplicable torment.

And:

> Peter snorted. "Who the hell knows?" he said. "Maybe it's delirium tremens.
> God knows I've drunk enough today to --" The tangle of his dark hair rustled
> on the pillow as he looked towards the window. "Hell, it's night," he said. He
> turned back quickly. "Time?" he asked.
>
> "After ten," said Jennings. "What about--?"
>
> "Thursday, isn't it?" asked Lang.
>
> Jennings stared at him.
>
> "No, I see it isn't"

The other valuable model I found in this is Matheson's portrayal of this
primitive ritual in the middle of an American Play-boy's apartment. It's a stark
contrast of cultures, with a bit of anti-racism mixed in. But the real value to
me as a writer is how Matheson plays through the ritual without having it come
off a cheesy. Dr. Howell (Lucine) presents herself and executes the ritual, as
bizarre as it is for the context, with sincere concern for Lang's well-being.
And to have the character behave with sincerity makes the piece feel genuine.
