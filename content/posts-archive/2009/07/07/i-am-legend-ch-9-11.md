So here we get more of Neville's backstory, the death of his wife, his
determination to bury her instead of burn her, and the horror of her return as a
vampire. It's interesting, but what really interested me more in these chapters
is how Matheson shows us real change in Neville.

Neville has continued sobering himself up, tackling his situation like a real
problem solver. He refers a few time to his father's belief in the scientific
method as inspiration. It's an interesting character development, so see Neville
set upon the library, reading and learning everything he can, teaching himself
to use a microscope, learning to understand what he's looking at, and ultimately
coming to the conclusion that this is a virus.

For me, it holds the same fascination as CSI or a police procedural. Matheson
does a good job of making the process of discovery itself interesting without
doing massive info dumps, giving just the information the reader needs to
understand the conclusions.

There was an additional piece in chapter 10 that I found noteworthy. Neville has
entered the library, which is still very neat, with all the chairs pushed in at
the tables. He's imaging the poor librarian who pushed them in the last time:

> He thought about that visionary lady. To die, he thought, never knowing the
> fierce joy and attendant comfort of a loved one's embrace. To sink into that
> hideous coma, to sink then into death and, perhaps, return to sterile, awful
> wanderings. All without knowing what it was to love and be loved.
>
> That was a tragedy more terrible than becoming a vampire.

Even in the midst of his situation, Neville can imagine something worse. It's a
clear sign that he's coming to grips with what's happening and is committing
himself to doing what he can to fix it.
