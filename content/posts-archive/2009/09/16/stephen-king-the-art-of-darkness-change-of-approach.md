I'm scrapping the chapter-by-chapter approach for my discussion on Douglas
Winter's book.

Instead, I've decided to do a series of posts, each of which discusses what I
found to be the most critical and relevant elements in Winter's analysis. Here's
a list of topics I expect to cover. I'll be spending no more than 30 minutes on
any given element to keep myself from rambling on.

- The "Night Journey" (East to West)
- The Haunted House
- Character growth from innocence to experience (tied to the "Night Journey")
- The corruption of Fairy Tale
- Vision and the writing process

That said, look for my first post in the next day or so. Technically, I'm on
vacation, but isn't vacation about doing the things you enjoy most?
