**Chapter 3 - Carrie**

In chapter 3, Winter begins his critical analysis of King's work with _Carrie_.

Here's what I took from this chapter:

- Winter considers _Carrie_ to be King's most eccentric work. In part, it seems,
  due to the epistolary structure.
- Right from the start, King's trademarks of "unassuming prose and truthful
  characterizations" are present.
- In King's own words, he'll go for terror, horror, and even the gross-out. Per
  Winter, _Carrie_ "evokes the visceral, bringing the reader down to the guy
  level at which King operates best."
- Winter quotes Peter Straub on the book: "...what was really striking about it
  was that it moved like the mind itself. It was an unprecedentedly direct
  style..."
- The book deals with the loneliness of one girl.
- It is a fairy tale, a warped Cinderella story.
- "The Cinderella imagery is made explicit when [Carrie] loses her slippers
  fleeing the ball."
- Carrie's final act of destruction "is not revenge -- nor is it evil."
- Popular entertainment stereotypes children, but horror fiction often strives
  for the inversion of innocence, "rendering children into agents of darkness
  for no other reason than exploitation." Winter cites _The Exorcist_ and _The
  Omen_.
- In Carrie, the "evil lies not in Carrie White but in her tormentors -- and,
  more important, in the traps of society and religious mania in which her
  tormentors are confined."
- Carrie White is, in Winter's words, "the first of many King protagonists who
  reflect his naturalist stance -- she starts nothing of her own free will."
- _Carrie_ is a story about the coming of age, showing the romantic side of King
  and his belief in the innate goodness of children.
- The coming of age in _Carrie_ is a journey - east to west.
- _Carrie_ also provides social commentary through a pervasive feminist element.
  "The blood imagery of _Carrie_ has sexual significance, not as an extension of
  erotic power...but of feminine power."
- In contrast to the traditional fairy tale, where the heroine succeeds at her
  trials and wins the kingdom, Carrie is pushed to the edge, left no alternative
  but violence, and were it not for her "gift", she would likely have failed.
- In King's words: "The fundamental unfairness of naturalistic storytelling is
  that it doesn't really admit for much optimism..."
- The final horror in the book is not Carrie's. It is Susan Snell, "who must
  live in the memory of blackness and its death song." Susan Snell survives but
  to what kind of life?

What I took from Winter's analysis is King's first published novel already sets
a pattern of naturalistic storytelling, of twisted fairy tales, and that the
idea of journey is fundamental to King's work. King's plain style and the
naturalism are a powerful combination.

**Chapter 4 - 'Salem's lot**

_'Salem's Lot_ is King's best-selling Vampire story. But, as Winter shows us, it
is not "just another vampire story." Winter tells us that the idea for the story
came from a discussion King had with his wife and his long-time friend Chris
Chelsey on "**what** might happen **if** Dracula returned in motern times... to
rural America." (Emphasis mine) King dismissed the idea at first, but "his
companions noted that almost anything could occur unnoticed in the small towns
of Maine." So King's book is modeled on the Stoker's _Dracula_, but Winter
points out that the difference in titles indicates the difference in focus.
Where Stoker's story focuses on the Count, King's focuses on the small town.

- For the majority of _'Salem's Lot_, Mr. Barlow, the king vampire, is kept out
  of site. It is a lesson King took from Dracula, the idea of building the fear
  around a character "by keeping him offstage."
- Winter also points out that the vampire is not just a literal thing, but it
  also representative of "the seductiveness of evil and the dehumanizing pall of
  moderns society." King uses the small town to amplify the vampire metaphor,
  showing the difference in views of the towns outsiders (Ben Mears) and the
  insiders.
- 'Salem's Lot differs from prior tradition in that the city is often the focal
  point of fear. "This sentimental antithesis between country and city serves as
  the underlying premise of _'Salem's Lot_.
- "King's style seduces the reader through suggestion and understatement."
- _'Salem's Lot_ is also a story about a "great house", and evil house
  - the Marsten House. It is a place with an evil history, and evil calls to
    evil, drawing the vampire to take up residence there.
- King draws heavily on traditional vampire myth in the story. Rather than try
  to reinvent the myth itself, he uses it in subtle ways to bring out the
  characters. Winter notes how Ben Mears is able to repel vampires with a cross
  made of tongue depressors while Father Callahan is unable to repel Barlow even
  with a blessed cross.
- King downplays the traditional sexual elements of the vampire myth, noting
  that at the time _Dracula_ was written the great Victorian secret was sex.
  When King wrote 'Salem's Lot, in the 1970's, King considers that the secret of
  the time was paranoia. So King himself considers that the story is in ways
  closer to _The Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ that it is to _Dracula_.
- The journey of Ben Mears is one from experience to innocence, that while he
  misses the past, he learns he cannot go home again.
- The "plague of vampires...is less an invasion than a sudden confirmation of
  what we have silently suspected all along: that we are taking over ourselves,
  individuals succumbing to the whole."
- Winter calls this the root of paranoia - "a fear and mistrust not simply of
  those around us, but of our very own identities.

I think the most important thing I take from this as a writer is that reusing
tradition and myth in a story does not require a reinvention of the myth. King
stuck to tradition here, the vampires were vampires as everyone knows and loves
them. The context in which they are applied is what makes this story unique.

The other piece I'm taking from this is the power of understatement. Barlow is
kept off-stage for most of the book, and King's writing style itself is cited as
one of "suggestion and understatement." Sometimes, what's not said is more
powerful than what is.
