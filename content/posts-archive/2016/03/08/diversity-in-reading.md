   by Jennifer McMahon

This is important. Not ground-shaking, earth-moving, sphincter-irritating
important, but important nonetheless.

But the important part isn't that _I_ did this.

The important part is the amount of **conscious** effort required to do this
this. I couldn't just merrily pick up books along the way like I've always done
and assume I'd come out with a reasonable amount of balance between male /
female.

Some of these are big names (yes, I never read Harry Potter), some are classic,
some are relatively new, and a couple I even know personally, but even so, I had
to make a super tremendous conscious effort to only read novels by women authors
for a year.

I could blame the publishing industry, or big bookstores, or Amazon, or even
Trump, but that kind of misses the point. Really, I can only blame myself,
because even though I made a big deal about how tough it was to do this just a
minute ago, it really wasn't all that difficult.

I just started asking people around me to very specifically recommend books by
women authors, and for the most part, they were able to come up with good
choices.

What do I think of these books I read by honorable women-folk? Well, Julianna
Baggott's PURE series (Pure, Fuse, Burn) is a wonderful post-apocalyptic tale,
and Caroline Kepnes' YOU is chilling to the bone, like watching a train full of
knives crash into a semi full of kittens. In fact, every one of these books I
found enjoyable and have no problem recommending.

This experiment showed that ensuring a reasonable amount of diversity in a
reading list really isn't all that hard. It's a matter of asking broadly, maybe
researching a little, and just thinking about it. That's all. Think about it.

I'm changing my reading habits from here on out and encourage everyone else who
might be lacking diversity to consider doing so as well. I'm planning my year of
reading out in advance, taking books from a broad range of recommendations and
lists, in an effort to not only shake up the genders on my list, but other forms
of diversity as well.

I've started my 2016 list already, and am balancing primarily on gender, but
it's only a start and I could use help. For instance, I know gender isn't binary
as I've made it out to be here, but like I said, this is just a start.

I'm wide open to suggestions on where to go from here, so leave a comment and
point me in the right direction, or share whatever tactics you might employ to
bring some diversity into your reading life.
