This one is actually my wife's idea.

This couple has this baby. The baby is very in tune to his/her parents, and it
can pick up on what they wish for. It begins granting their wishes. Sounds a
little weird, but I remember reading once that one of the Native American tribes
believes (or believed) that we are born with knowledge of the language of the
gods, and that we forget it as we grow up, forgetting completely by age 4.
Interesting....
