1000 words per day. If you write 1000 words per day, you can crank out a lot of
writing. I've seen indications around that a writer's 'apprenticeship' should
amount to one million written words. If you can do 1000 words a day, then an
apprenticeship amounts to about 3 years.

I have no idea if that stuff about an 'apprenticeship' is true, if it really
takes one million words before a writer achieves that almost mindless level of
production to consider themselves a writer. What I do know is that 1000 words a
day is a good target for me. It'll get me cranking out a short story per week.
