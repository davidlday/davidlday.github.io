I set up this new site today. It's my first step in publicizing myself as a
writer. My wife recently gave birth to our first son (also David L. Day), and
during the course of her pregnancy, as well as the three weeks I was off after
the delivery, I came to realize something. I want my son to learn a lot of
things about life, and one in particular is that he should never give up on
pursing his dreams.

One of the things _I've_ learned in life is that the best way to lead is by
example. I realized that I had given up on pursing one of my dreams, one that is
very important to me. Being a writer.

I've taken it back up. I don't expect to become rich or famous, and I'm not sure
if I'll ever be able to make a full time living out of it. But there is no
reason, nor has there ever been a real reason, for me to not be a writer. I
write, I love to write, and if I happen to be good enough, I'll make money at
it.

My son should have the confidence and persistence to follow through on his
dreams, no matter where they may lead.
