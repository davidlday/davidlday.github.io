```poem
Mildly blamed abandon,
     a vanishing madness
     poignant over the boundlessness
     of hot yard, pagan-hearted discontent;
     of sweet man, with verbatim extreme control.

Mighty punishment out of turn
     casting the bound shrine,
     a bygone tomb,
     where indeed electricity
     arcs truly their legend.

Regional bloody faith
     itemizes the witnesses.
     Grave-wide perceptible excuses
     condemn religious humility
     with calculated infected ejaculations.

Weakness wrought out of structure
     holding dearly
     to the offending horn.
     Faltering skins swallow anything,
     downcast moonlight their restraint.
