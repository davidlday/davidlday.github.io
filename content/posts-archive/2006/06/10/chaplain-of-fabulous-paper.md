```poem
Put out the eyes of foresight,
    which underneath taught torrential calm
    despite the thrilling clear acumen.
    Take ease in the transparent
    steady slumber which it allies like
    privileged unmasked liquid,
    binding sanity to impulse,
    a manifold chord.

Demonic rum,
    harmless to the churchman's skeleton,
    that rabbit of relief and sovereign egotist,
    loops prejudice and indexes possibilities
    preying on resident thoughts
    which tingle with ill passing.
    Enter the transfusion of flashing
    standstills germane to grasping,
    leaving us to stare at appealing refractions.

I am the chaplain of more fabulous
    paper, armed to a depth
    improper of my horn.

Eat now the radiant fable
    that plagues appreciative solitude,
    growling and guessing
    at the unscrupulous gateway.
    Feast on the conventional desert;
    a sharp, breakable universe
    suspended in abandonment.

Wear proud the handsome,
    crescent number inscribed on your courage;
    that figure which sometimes distributes
    terms of a malignant image,
    tied southwest to northeast;
    a frenzied, faithless host.

Dream assured, inventor
    of my outer octagonal tear,
    in the havoc of shines
    devoted to that balancing stage,
    longing command
    parallel to criminal cosmic budgets.

Mark now the forehead
    byway of tearing westward
    a red diversion,
    swift and half sure crop rags.

Join the experimental homecoming union,
    grinding cllutchless sympathy.
    Bleed of the surroundings
    that loop and bind our feet.
    Battle the occasional barbarian
    dream in curious structure.

Critical routes
    pass disgusting guardians
    and common horror lust.
    Puncture blind unreality,
    pages of prayer upon daily prayer,
    a harmless price.

The firm, pale reef-joint boasts
    crisp, mean contempt,
    guarded of my winning current.
    Addled of that attempted habitually
    withdrawn structure,
    ladies growl diamond clusters.

Today darts alert,
    waking the past with vapor
    flash sacrifice cries.
    Crawl inside the hypnotic ash
    which den
    ies collapse in plain appreciation.
    Bone rough and wounded glare
    wilderness cunning.

Temperament counters a
    leaky social class.
    Hearing good never grew
    almighty author of wounds.
    Slow that irony which grants
    a fire beacon army,
    rendered well to anguish
    away the high human nerve slab
    whose plight dates back to
    assent exhaustion.

Aerial compass of low damp glory,
    a humble scientist cock
    full of suggestion, rooted and flying.

Shiver the roar of gray
    floating assemblage glee.
    Welcome is the contrary
    necessity of trousers,
    a healthy accord of westward agreement.
    Attract large thunder comprehension
    that neglects schooling character,
    a stupidity shock to confuse us.
