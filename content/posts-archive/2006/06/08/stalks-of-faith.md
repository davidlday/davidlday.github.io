```poem
A helpless yellow disciple of anger,
    precariously fluttering against the concrete earth.

Preachers and brethren,
    hung by the umbilical stalk of faith,
    shake and chortle.

The wavering spine of desire,
    snapped and severed
    by the coarse sparks of flesh.

Red tenderness is found
    by flames of will.
```
