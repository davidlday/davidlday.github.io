A young lawyer joins a new firm. Shortly after, he begins to undergo some
bizarre physiological changes. He loses his appetite, is unable to drink much of
anything, and has a host of flu-like symptoms.

Not long after this begins, he receives a package - no return address, no
identifying marks. The post markings on it are in a foreign language and
indecipherable. Inside he finds an unusual ring, pure silver, fashioned in the
shape of a triangle with the relief image of folded hands inside of it.
