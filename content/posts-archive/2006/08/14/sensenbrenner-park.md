An old man, used up by his years of corporate loyalty. He has spent each evening
leaving work late, stopping by a fountain, tossing a coin in. No wishes, no
prayers, just a donation. Now, his retirement eve, the end of an uneventful day
with the obligatory cake and cards, he stops at the fountain one last time. It
is later than usual, nearly midnight, and he is alone by the fountain.

A young man joins him, both sitting by the fountain, and makes him an offer. A
reset button, but will not disclose the price. The man takes it, and it is again
his first day on the job.
