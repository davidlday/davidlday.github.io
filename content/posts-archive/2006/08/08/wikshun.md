I have an idea....

Wiki's have become awfully big, and they're great at semantically linking
information together. However, they're most suited towards documentation and
fact gathering. I've seen one site -
[The Fiction Wikia](http://novelas.wikia.com/ "The Fiction Wikia") - that tries
to apply the wiki concept to story telling, but I think it has several
shortcomings. The most notable is that it forces each and every author on the
site to use the same license, the
[GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html "Gnu Free Documentation License"),
which is great for information sharing, but is in my opinion not well suited to
the fiction writer. In my opinion, the Creative Commons licenses are much more
appropriate, and provide the freedom and flexibility needed for sharing
fictional work.

Enter "wikshun". Wikshun is not a single site, but it is an approach to writing.
The idea is to create a mesh of wiki-like sites, each under the control of a
single author. On each site, the author would publish their own fiction, and
optionally host that of other authors in their own namespaces.

The author(s) would then enhance their fiction by providing semantically linked
detail for each story. For instance, on the first appearance of a character's
name, it would be a link to a character bio, either in a generalized
"characters" namespace, or under the exiting store (Story/CharacterName). The
same type of linking could be applied to settings, dates, special objects or
items (i.e. Tolkien's
"[Ring of Barahir](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Ring_of_Barahir "Ring of Barahir at LOTR Wikia")").

What does all this get you? Well, with each new page standing as an individually
copyrightable piece of work, each author can choose to apply different licenses
to different pieces. For instance, I may not want anyone deriving directly from
my short stories, but I'm more than happy to not only let people derive from,
but directly copy and use my characters as described in their character sheets.

I might also be more than happy to let authors place their stories in some
wonderful setting I've invented. With each new tale that takes place there, the
setting itself can become expanded and enhanced. With using wiki technology,
these stories can be interlinked relatively easily, allowing for writers to
concentrate on doing what they really want to do - write.

Why would anyone want to do this? Well, for one, it's a good way for new authors
to expose their work to the world, under their own licensing terms. Licenses
could range from the GFDL all the way to the typical restrictive copyright, and
an author can have finer control of what he would like to allow other writers to
use.
