```poem
Flesh-eating hearts
    nurtured on line-soup
    nurse ivory anguish
    that is bidden thirsty for us.

Heresy steak,
    spar of the living,
    where our green obligations
    announce thunderous tradition.

Coal redresses discontent
    implication,
    shudders resistance,
    a dizzy unseen statement.

Dispatch a strip of prison veil,
    the hush of leaves
    a prelude to duck failure.

Lunch,
    that obstructed, devoted meal.
```
