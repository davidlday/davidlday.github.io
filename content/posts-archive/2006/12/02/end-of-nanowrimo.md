NaNoWriMo wrapped up, of course, on November 30. How'd I do? I wound up with a
word count of 48,459. Not the goal of NaNoWriMo, I know. But, it satisfies me
that with an outline, and setting aside a few hours a night for writing 5 out of
7 days a week, I can make some tremendous progress towards a novel. Personally,
after doing this the second time, I've come to agree with
[these wise words](http://www.antimuse.org/blog/?p=25 "AntiBlog") - I'd rather
have spent the time writing something worth reading than cranking out 50,000
words worth of crap.

Some of the participants I checked ran way over, some nearing 100,000 words, but
when I checked their excerpts, I must say **YAWN**. Not worth the time. Not one
excerpt I read sparked my interested except maybe the one for a piece titled
[AFTRLYF](http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=102730 "NaNoWriMo profile").
To be honest, I only checked people in my region, and maybe, just **maybe**
there's truth to the 700 monkeys for 700 years, that one of these folks has
turned out the works of the master himself, but I'd be hard-pressed to figure
out which one it was!

Long and short, with a writing plan, I've proven to myself that I can still
maintain home life, my full time job, and produce sizable and (hopefully)
worthwhile works of fiction in a reasonable amount of time. Oh, and the piece I
started is only about half done. I wasn't in any hurry to meet the NaNoWriMo
goal necessarily because it was in no way indicative of the novel I'm writing.
