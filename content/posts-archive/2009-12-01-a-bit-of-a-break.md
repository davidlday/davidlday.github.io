I've been on break from school since beginning of November, so I took the
opportunity to brush up on mechanics. Specifically, I took a much-needed browse
through the old _Elements of Style_. Good little book. But, I wanted more. So, I
found a more contemporary take on style, [Sin and Syntax](http://bit.ly/633eMV),
by Constance Hale. It's longer than Elements. There's plenty of praise for the
book out in the wild; I'll say I'm glad I took the time to read it as well. How
do I know? Some of my writing from as recent as a year ago makes me cringe.
[sigh] Shortly after I finished, I set about some serious revision work on a few
older short stories.

I just started reading _Old Man's War_, by John Scalzi, the reading selection
for my January writer's residency. I've not decided if I'll do any journal posts
or not on it, since it's not Horror. First impressions [2 chapters]: Scalzi
makes good use of the CDF contract as a framing device for providing background
information to the reader; he does an equally good job of slipping in a space
elevator explanation during casual conversation. Those are just the first two
things that came to mind; I am enjoying it as well.

Finally, I've started work on new short story based on the name of a character
that I've carried around for a few years. I didn't mean for it to be a zombie
story -- already tried my hand at zombies once -- but... it's a zombie story.

BTW - Beware the Krampus!
