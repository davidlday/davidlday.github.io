Part of being a professional writer is ensuring your submissions meet format
guidelines. [William Shunn](http://www.shunn.net/format/) developed a set of
format guidelines, originally published in December 1998 edition of
[Writers Write: The Internet Writing Journal](http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/dec98/shunn.htm).
He also provides a set of [templates](http://www.shunn.net/format/wp.html) on
his site, but unfortunately they are only for WordPerfect. I use
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org).

I decided to create my own templates based on his guidelines and offer them here
for all to use. I emailed Mr. Shunn several times over the past year to ask
permission to post these, and never received a response. I decided to go ahead
and offer them anyhow, and if Mr. Shunn objects, I will remove them.

Shunn has three format guidelines: Short Story, Novel, and Poem. While I write
poetry for my own amusement, I don't try to market it, so my templates only
include Short Story and Novel. If there's enough interest in a Poem template,
I'll add it.

Instructions

1.  Download the zip:
    [Shunn OpenOffice Templates](/images/imported/2010/06/Shunn-OpenOffice-Templates.zip)
2.  Extract to any directory. You should see two files: "Shunn Novel Format.ott"
    and "Shunn Short Story Format.ott"
3.  In OpenOffice Writer, select **File \>\> Templates \>\> Organize** from the
    menu.
4.  In the left-hand pane, double-click "My Templates" from the list.
5.  On the right-hand side, select **Commands \>\> Import Templates...**.
6.  Browse to the extracted files and select one. It should now appear in the
    left-hand pane under "My Templates".
7.  Repeat steps 5 and 6, selecting the other file.

That's it! You should now be able create a new document by selecting **File \>\>
New \>\> Templates and Documents**. You should now have two new templates
listed!

I am also working on a set of templates for Microsoft Word since I sometimes use
it as well.
