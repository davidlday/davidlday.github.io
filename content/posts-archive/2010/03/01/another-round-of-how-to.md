This is the first of three posts on _How to Write Tales of Horror, Fantasy &
Science Fiction_, Edited by J. N. Williamson. The book is a collection of How-To
articles by some of the best horror writers, circa 1987.

Late last year I did a series of posts on _On Writing Horror_, another
collection of How-To articles by some of horror's best writers circa 2007.
Twenty years separate the publication of these two books, but so far I haven't
found anything other than the market survey that really differentiate the two.
I've commented before that information repeated across authors is usually good
advice, and I think that's still true. But, I'm a little disappointed that I
haven't found anything new here. Yet.

**\*The Editor's Forward: Certain of What We Do Not See\*\*\***, J. N.
Williamson\*\*

Williamson gives a brief survey of the markets, then dives into providing
definitions for the fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres. What I found
most interesting is that Williamson states very clearly that the book was
published:

> ...to help you write publishable novels or stories for the three genres
> coexisting beneath that umbrella term, _fantasy_: horror, or dark fantasy;
> science fiction; and fantasy itself.

I think it's important to remember that horror, science fiction, and fantasy
really fall under this one umbrella of fantasy.

**_Introduction: How to Write Horribly for Fun and Profit_, Robert Bloch**

I would sum up Bloch's article as: Let the story dictate genre and length.

According to Bloch, hackwork flooded the market at that time (his words, not
mine). And most of that work consisted of ideas stretched to meet commercial
needs. He says that the difference between current authors and those who endured
is that the enduring authors had something to say and knew how to say it.

He says of horror that some work succeeds on the "fast-read" level, but that he
doubts it will endure. He also thinks that the films of the day were an
influence on the "heavy-handed sex and violence" that permeated horror and had
little to do with story.

Then he gets to the most interesting part. He talks about interior logic, and
how it poses a problem for horror fiction. Nightmares are "...inconsistent and
episodic." But to scare a reader, the writer must present the premise in a
logical framework. I have struggled with this in my writing. When I have ideas
or inspiring dreams (nightmares), they do come in clips, often laden with
personal symbolism that reinforces them as frightening. To turn those ideas into
a story, I have to work at wrapping a presentable, logical framework around
them. Although performing that transformation is challenging, it helps to
clarify the original idea into something much more meaningful. I also find that
the process brings out opportunities for originality, which Bloch believes is
necessary for success.

**_Run Fast, Stand Still, or, The Thing at the Top of the Stairs, or, New Ghosts
from Old Minds_, Ray Bradbury**

Bradbury discusses an idea also found in Stephen King's _On Writing_: stories
are found things. He does this by describing his own personal development as a
writer. He wrote fast, he wrote a lot, and he let himself make mistakes. He
wound up with an interesting process: he keeps lists of nouns and periodically
reviews them for items that seem to click together into a story. He also learned
that his "...characters would do [his] work for [him]." The more he worked
through his process, the more ideas he built, and the more stories he developed.

Bradbury sums up his creative habit as such:

> If I had not made up these prescriptions for Discovery I would never have
> become the jackdaw archaeologist or anthropologist that I am.

I'm discovering the same thing in my development. Working on a story is more
like discovering than creating. I think it's a little difficult for my critique
partners--or will be soon--as I often submit things out of sequence. But, it's
how the story comes around for me. I set an idea down, I pull together some
characters, and I let them work it out. As the story takes shape, I discover new
facets and characters that I feel must have been present all along, I just
hadn't seen them yet. The more I write, the more I uncover. That could lead to
wandering and voluminous work, but I temper it with economy of language.

I think the metaphor of writer as archaeologist works for me, so I'll hang onto
it for now.

**\*Plotting as Your Power Source\*\*\***, J. N. Williamson\*\*

I have mixed reactions to Williamson's essay on Plot. He breaks it down into 4
parts.

​1. Defining the Plot

Williamson claims hat all novels must have a sense that things are going
somewhere. One can hardly disagree:

> ...a plot is _not_ an idea, one fairly well-rounded character, a flurry of
> conversation climaxed by a quarrel, kiss-and-make-up, and a cheery platitude.
> That is a _vignette_.

So what is plot? I had a little trouble picking out a clean definition, other
than it's the mechanism to keep things moving forward. He cites Koontz's article
(later in the book) by saying plot is the skeleton, reiterates that plot is the
sense of things moving forward, calls it "...a means of transportation for the
characters in your fiction," and again cites Koontz as saying that plot is the
"most demanding task that a novelist must face...". So plot is what keeps the
story moving forward. I'm not entirely sure if that's a workable definition, but
there's nothing I can't accept in it.

To me, plot is the connecting threads under all the scenes in a story. It's why
all the pieces of a story are present, what makes them related. That's not so
different from Williamson's definition, nor any clearer.

​2. Plotting Unpredictably

Williamson states pretty clearly that, for the genres in question, the best
stories have plots that contain unpredictable elements. Again, I can agree with
Williamson. The best horror stories are those that take the reader by surprise
at some point.

​3. Plotting with the Outline

Here is where my opinion diverges from Williamson. This is the old argument for
Plotting as opposed to "pantsing" (making it up as you go along). I'm still
working out which is right for me, but I suspect that most writers are actually
neither. Sure, we can plan out the work up from all we want, but at some point
while we're writing, things will change. A plan is not the final product, and
there's no way to know what will and won't work until you get to it. I prefer to
get into the work. When I want to, I can be prolific. I don't mind wasting words
on the page if it helps me work out the story. In fact, that's plotting, right?
It just so happens that I plot better during my writing process and not before
it.

That aside, Williamson provides some more advice:

- Start everything in the middle of action. Too many works start with
  exposition. He blames this on working without an outline, but the self-editing
  process can excise the extra verbiage. What harm is it if it helps me think,
  so long as I take it out later?
- End with all significant questions answered.
- Every crisis must advance the plot, show more about your characters, and show
  more about the "enigma that resides at the soul of your plot."
- Follow expository scenes with action scenes.
- Use a thesaurus.

​4. The Art of Plotting

I wasn't clear on what Williamson was getting at in this last section. I think
he's trying to say that plotting is essential to producing good art. I agree if
he's saying that all good stories need a good plot, but I still disagree with
the idea that outlining is the only means of producing a good plot. Once again,
he cites Koontz, and the quote is worth repeating:

> The purpose of fiction is communication, and if the work is not read, the
> purpose is not fulfilled.

Very true. But there's still nothing to refute the idea that there are many ways
of producing a good plot. The idea that a writer must use an outline to plot is
very narrow-sighted, in my opinion. The writer must learn what works for them.

**\*Reality and the Waking Nightmare: Setting and Character in Horror
Fiction\*\*\***, Mort Castle\*\*

Castle centers his essay around the idea of story time. In order to effectively
draw the reader into story time, the writer must create credible fiction. And,
the key to credibility, in Castle's opinion, is setting and character.

These items are more important in horror (actually, any fantasy) because, by the
very nature of the genre the reader is already asked to accept some wild
"What-if". In order to keep the reader immersed in sustainable suspension of
believe, everything around the story's wild premise must be as believable as
possible. So Castle suggests that we keep everything else (setting and
character) as grounded in reality as possible.

He provides two reasons for such.

- Readers are familiar with the ordinary, and relate to it without the writer
  having to put significant work into building that relationship.
- Horror happens with the extraordinary infringes upon the ordinary.

I to agree with both of these ideas. The most terrifying stories are those with
characters and settings to which we can relate. It takes the story from an idea
to a demonstration of possibility in our lives.

**_One View: Creating Character in Fantasy and Horror Fiction_, Steve Rasnic
Tem**

Why is creating character in SF/F/H any different that other genres? Tem tells
us that the idea that characters in our genre are simply ordinary folks tossed
into extraordinary conditions is false. The concept ignores that stories are
made things--artifacts that the writer uncovers and develops. Characters cannot
be separated from their context, so the writer must develop a context that helps
the reader understand how the fantastic characterizes the protagonist (or
presumably any character). He references the Twilight Zone, and how it made
consistent use of "something wrong...dropped into the midst of [a] highly
realistic context." The best writers use this situation of a strange situation
to "peer more deeply into the souls of the characters".

Tem goes on to discuss dream characterization, based on a theory of "gestalt
dream interpretation" that "suggests that every object in a dream is a piece of
the dreamer." Tem suggests this idea can be used in horror if the writer
consider that everything in a story that's not the protagonist is still
representation of the protagonist in some way. I find this an interesting
approach, but I think it breaks in very complex stories, or stories where the
protagonist and the POV character are different.

Detail is also more important in SF/F/H than in other genres, according to Tem.
He states that in science fiction, "people and communities characterized by the
devices...they choose to surround themselves with." And that in horror, the
reader needs to focus on detail to better understand the character, and possibly
recognize things about the characters they either ignore or deny.

Finally, Tem links character and plot, stating that using plot to characterize
just extends the idea of characterization through action. He suggests that if
working in the context of dream characterization, that those actions that happen
to a character must also be considered reflections of the character. Sounds like
karma to me.

Where do we find ideas for characters? Tem says:

> Once you have developed a process of characterization that is intimately
> connected to all the elements of a story, you will be able to find complete
> and compelling characters just about anywhere.

But he doesn't leave it there. He actually provides a list of things that might
inspire character, including: anxiety, autobiographies, fear, obsession, dark
folk tales, and the anxieties of an era.

I think Tem provides an interesting framework--dream characterization--for
developing characters, but I'm not convinced it would apply broadly. As I said
before, I think if the POV character is different from the protagonist, then it
would be difficult for the POV character to get an exact lens on how the
surrounding work is a reflection of some other character. But, maybe I'm wrong.
This is something I'll have to play with later to figure out.

**_"Oh, Just Call Me Cuthbert": The Naming Game_, Thomas Millstead**

What's in a name? Millstead says there's a lot, and that as writers we must pay
attention to the "vast importance of names in tales intended to chill, thrill,
or enthrall." Providing good names is important in all fiction, but Millstead
tells us it is even more important in the fantasy genres because they strive to
get at something deeper and become more than just representational of reality.

> What makes the fanciful real, what gives it substance, is a name so apt that,
> in retrospect, it could be nothing else.

That seems pretty daunting at first. I think he's right--names are critical
because they are usually a reader's first brush with the things they represent.
We introduce characters and places and things by name, or we withhold the name
(on rare occasion) to create impact later in the story. They have to be the
right names.

How do we get the names right? Millstead tells us there are no criteria for
picking the right ones, just an underlying precept. The names must be compatible
with the tone and texture of the story. Don't make the names an afterthought.
Avoid making hasty decisions, and pinning on names that are drab, suggest the
wrong ethnic or social backgrounds, or overlap in sound.

**_Involving Your Reader from the Start_, William F. Nolan**

Nolan tells us that, "...the acid test of a story is its opening. A good story
should leap off the page, grab you by the throat, and demand, 'Read me!'".

That pretty much sums up the article. The rest is a listing of about 20 opening
lines from his own work. They are interesting to review, and are good
demonstrations of opening lines that grab.

He closes by saying that we live in a fast society, submerged in a variety of
media, and that in order for writers to compete they must produce works that
seize the reader's attention. If you don't get them quickly, they have plenty of
other options to explore. This article is copyright 1987. It was true then, and
even more true now. As technology has blossomed, our readers have plenty of
other options for entertainment. We might like to pretend that the written art
is somehow "better" than television or movies, but I would reiterate the Koontz
quote from earlier:

> The purpose of fiction is communication, and if the work is not read, the
> purpose is not fulfilled.

To be read, the writer must learn to compete effectively against the other media
outlets. Grab the reader as quickly as possible, and never let go until the end.

**_Freedom of Originality in Fantastic Fiction--and How to Use It_, James
Kisner**

Kisner claims that the genres in question give the writer more opportunity for
originality than the others. The writer must train his imagination to recognize
for two reasons. First, "the mind is easily fooled into grasping the obvious and
claiming it for its own." Second, he says that beginning writers are told
incorrectly that there's nothing new--it's all been done before.

How do we urge originality? Kishner reiterates what all writers should be doing:
read and study. The more work a writer is exposed to the more likely they are to
avoid the mundane. He suggests that the writer who keeps notes on original works
and analyzes those works considered original is better able to find originality
in his own work. Kishner also reiterates the now familiar advice of reading
across genres.

He cautions against letting a single work define what is original, and also
states there is danger in reading too much. Apparently the key is to read just
the right amount. I jest. I think the advice here is correct, but it's not new
by today's standards.

There is one place to use as a sort of 'originality checker' that I was not
familiar with. He suggests getting writer's guidelines from publishers, as they
will often include a list of things to avoid. So far, I've only encountered one
such list, but I also have yet to start marketing any book-length fiction.

I agree originality is important, but I think Kisner missed one item that can
spark originality. As T. S. Eliot said:

> When forced to work within a strict framework the imagination is taxed to its
> utmost - and will produce its richest ideas. Given total freedom the work is
> likely to sprawl.

I think originality can also be encouraged by placing constraints on yourself.
Back yourself into a corner and see how you get out.

**\*Creating Fantasy Folk\*\*\***, Ardath Mayhar\*\*

Mayhar provides two means for developing fantasy folks--by which he means
anything not existing, not just elves, etc.

1. Begin with a world and its characteristics, then figure out what kind of
   creatures could live there.
2. Begin with a creature that has to be a certain way, then develop the
   surrounding context.

These seem obvious to me. Mayhar provides a couple examples, but I didn't find
anything very interesting in either of these.

But, he does wrap up with some very important advice. As writers, we can't let
the plot get overwhelmed by explanations of our fantastic creatures. Whatever
information a reader needs to understand our creatures must come out naturally
in the narrative and dialog. They must be treated as any other character:

> Its appearance and habits must come through observation of the being in
> action.

I thought of Lovecraft when I read this, who is at times given to providing long
explanations of his creatures. I think that may be part of why some readers are
less than thrilled with his work. In other words, "Show, don't tell."

**_Keeping the Reader on the Edge of His Seat_, Dean R. Koontz**

Koontz introduces two kinds of suspense: light, and dark. The light kind of
suspense is the roller coaster ride, something fun and desirable. The darker
kind "strains your heart, breaks your spirit." He says that only in fiction do
we actually seek both kinds of suspense, because fiction is vicarious. Readers
are drawn toward tales that can show how to face tragedy with dignity.

Koontz cautions us against confusing action for suspense, and says that action
can only be suspense if the writer understands:

> ​(1) suspense in fiction results primarily from the reader's identification
> with and concern about lead characters who are complex, convincing, and
> appealing; and (2) anticipation of violence is infinitely more suspenseful
> than the violence itself.

I agree with Koontz, but I think the first is another way of saying that the
reader must care for your characters. That's common advice among my reading. I
think the second point is the key. Anticipation serves the writer better than
well-described acts of violence. To be fair, I've engaged in the latter, but
that doesn't make it right. You give the reader more when you build up
anticipation.

Koontz continues to tell us that good, likable characters are important for
horror because the best horrors are those we find lurking inside the hearts and
minds of people. In order to get our reader to come down that path, we must
present them with characters whose heads they want to get into.

One piece I've not heard emphasized before is the importance of style. Koontz
claims it is as important as characterization and anticipation because it is the
flow of words on the page that carry the reader along. The downside of this
advice, in my opinion, is that style is only developed, not learned. I've been
working on understanding my style the past six months, and it's a challenge.
