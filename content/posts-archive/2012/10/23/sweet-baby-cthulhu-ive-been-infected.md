The hip and talented writer
[Stephanie Wytovich](http://joinmeinthemadhouse.blogspot.com/2012/10/author-infection.html)
tagged me in a game of author infection. The rules are simple. Search your work
in progress for the first use of “look”. Copy and paste that paragraph and the
ones immediately before and after into a blog post. Then, like all good chain
letters, tag five other authors. Wash, rinse, repeat.

This is from the nearly finished first draft of my novel _The Galvanized Man_.
What kind of novel, you ask? I once described it as squishing Lovecraft and J.J.
Abrams into a dark post-apocalyptic cult fantasy. Yeah, I guess that works.

There you have it. Although what you have doesn’t really tell you anything. Oh
well, hope you enjoyed it anyhow.

Now I’m off to spread this disease to five other lucky writers, like the
undulating tentacles of the god who dreams in his sunken city.
