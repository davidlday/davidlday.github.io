Here’s a quick updated on Tearstone. The manuscript is now in the hands of
[Tracy DeVore](http://tracydevore.com/), Senior Editor for
[Belfire Press](http://www.belfirepress.com/). Tracy’s a published author,
freelance editor, and former newspaper correspondent. She was also founding
president of the Horror Writers Association’s Indiana chapter, and I feel lucky
to be working with her.

The front cover art will be handled by
[Bob Freeman](http://www.occultdetective.com/). No ETA on it yet, but I’ll share
updates as I’m able.

The timeline has shifted a little. When I originally signed with Belfire,
Tearstone was tentatively scheduled for March 2013. Shortly after, Belfire
rearranged their schedule and moved Tearstone up to February 2013. I now have a
production schedule for Tearstone and the release has moved to March 29, 2013.
I’m very excited to see a schedule in place, and I’m confident everything will
move pretty much as Belfire’s Editor in Chief
[Jodi Lee](http://jodilee.sacredtriskele.net/) has planned.

I’ll post more updates here as we move through the editing process. I’ll also
keep my [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/author.davidlday) updated.
