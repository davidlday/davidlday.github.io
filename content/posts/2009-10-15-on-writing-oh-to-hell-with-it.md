The last section of "On Writing Horror" is all about the business aspect of
being a writer.  It provides a nice overview of the current markets, good
resources for research and promotion, and some worthwhile advice from editors
and writers alike.

Here's the advice I'm taking right now, given by _Night Shade Books_:

> Write what you think is your best book.  Put it in a trunk and write another
> one.  Do this four times.  Then start sending your novels out for submission.

So, while it's never too early to build awareness about the market, right now
I'm focusing on building my writing skills.  If there's nothing to sell, there's
nothing to market.

Oh, and the afterword by Harlan Ellison - quite cool.

I'm done with this book, moving on to the next.
