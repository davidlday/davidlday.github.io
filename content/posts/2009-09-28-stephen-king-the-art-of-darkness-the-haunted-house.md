Another element Winter discusses in his analysis of King is the haunted
house.  What strikes me as most interesting with this is that, while I
think Winter does a good job of identifying the various 'haunted houses'
in King's works, he never seems to talk about what the idea of 'setting
as character' directly.

For context, Winter identifies the following as noteworthy 'haunted
houses':

-   The Martsen House in *'Salem's Lot*
-   The Overlook Hotel in *The Shining*
-   The Agincourt Hotel in *The Talisman*
-   The Dark Tower in *The Dark Tower* series \*

The last one is my own addition.  At the time of Winter's writing, The
Dark Tower was still in its infancy, with only the first book having
been published.  And, as I look back over King's works, there's
definitely other minor places (settings) that would also qualify as
'haunted houses', but these four represent to me the most important
aspect.

Haunted Houses are a prime example of setting as character.  Each of
these 'houses' plays an active part in their story to varying degrees. 
The Martsen House is an active attractor for "Mr. Barlow".  It is a
shadow in the Ben Mears' past and a shadow on the town in general.  It
draws Mr. Barlow for no other reason than evil attracts evil.

The Overlook Hotel, likewise, is an active attractor.  It is the
archetypal bad place, an accumulation of all the bad things that have
happened in its history.  It is this bad history that connects it with
Jack Torrence, who has his own bad history.  As with *'Salem's Lot*,
evil again attracts evil.  The two 'characters' actively feed off each
other to escalate the story towards its conclusion.

The last two are different, in that I wouldn't necessarily classify them
as evil.  But they do represent haunted houses as characters in the
sense that they are weak points where other worlds show through, and the
nature of that weakness provides them active parts in their stories. 
Both structures serve to demonstrate that there are multiple worlds,
multiple universes, of which the current settings for each story are
only a small part.  They demonstrate this for the reader, but they also
seem to actively influence those worlds, as if containment or reflection
of the 'multiverse' somehow has endowed them with ownership and life.

It's only been a year or so since I've started to consider working with
the idea of 'setting as character'.  But it wasn't until reading
Winter's book that I considered the specific setting of 'haunted house'
as a character.  It's a natural fit, I think, one I'm surprise I didn't
connect with before.
