I got up this morning, groggy as hell. Yeah, getting up at 4 am will do that to
ya. But, it's paying off! In my inbox was my first acceptance notice! My short
story, Gray, is to be published in the January 2009 edition of
[Necrotic Tissue](http://www.necrotictissue.com "Necrotic Tissue.")!

Sweeeeet... I'm going back to bed.
