I'm done with WordPress. It's wonderful, but it's too much for me. I know in
this day and age it seems every aspiring writer runs a tight blog, with frequent
posts and guests and insightful advice on writing. But that's not for me.

I spent too much time over the past few years tweaking and tuning WordPress, not
enough time actually writing posts, and beating myself up over both. So I'm
ditching the pretense that I'm a blogger. I'm not. I want to write wonderful
short stories and novels, and while blogging may help some in their pursuit of
genre writing, it doesn't help me. It stresses me out, which is not what I need.

So, I'm archiving my old WordPress site to http://archive.davidlday.com and in
its place I'm putting a single page with information on me, my writing, and
links to things I think it worthwhile for readers or writers of genre fiction.

So long, WP. You've been a good friend, but a little too needy. Who knows...
Maybe we'll get back together somewhere down the road.
