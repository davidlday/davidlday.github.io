Just got back from residency orientation @ Seton Hill.  It's nice to be back,
even if it meant driving 4 hours through snow.  I had a great break, had a
couple of good reads while I was off.  First was John Scalzi's _Old Man's War_,
a very entertaining science fiction book.  It's not my typical flavor, but it
kept me reading, full of good action and interesting characters.

My other read was _The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror, Volume 20_, edited by
Stephen Jones.  It's filled with some excellent short horror from 2008, and
definitely worth the time.  It's late, I'm tired, so I won't do any sort of
review of them, but here's a list of the one's that appealed most to me:

- _It Runs Beneath the Surface_, by Simon Strantzas
- _These Things We Have Always Known_, by Lynda E. Rucker (my favorite of the
  lot)
- _Through the Cracks_, by Gary McMahon
- _The Camping Wainwrights_, by Ian R. MacLeod
- _The Oram County Whoosit_, by Steve Duffy (excellent story in the vein of
  Lovecraft)
- _The_ New York Times _at Special Bargain Rates_, by Stephen King
- _2:00 pm: The Real Estate Agent Arrives_, by Steve Rasnic Tem

That last one verges on poetic.  It's shorter than this post, a mere 3
sentences, but paints a beautifully horrific picture and punches you in the
end.  Loved it!

And now, I'm off to see if I can wrap up some stuff before getting into the
groove tomorrow.
