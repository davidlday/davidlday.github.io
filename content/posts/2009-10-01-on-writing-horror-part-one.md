Today I'm starting my journal entries for _On Writing Horror_, A Handbook by
[The Horror Writer's Association](http://www.horror.org). The book contains
about 50 individual articles, divided among 8 different sections, so I'm going
to match my entries up to the sections rather than address the articles
individually.

Part one is called "Horror, Literature, and Horror Literature". The three
articles in this section seem to address whether Horror Fiction is or isn't
Literary Fiction. Or more broadly, the contention between Genre Fiction and
Literary Fiction that seems to be pervasive, and has been for quite some time,
in the literary community.

**_The Madness of Art_, Joyce Carol Oates**

Oates talks about art forms in general, and how in the visual arts there seems
to be no mainstream or convention that divides the community. In music, there is
almost the opposite extreme - that the classics continue to be classics while
contemporary composes struggle for access to small audiences. I guess she's not
talking about mainstream or popular music, because I think if you include all
the rock/pop/alternative musicians (those who get 80% of the radio coverage),
then the same problem occurs as you see in literature. Pop artists are rarely if
ever considered 'serious' musicians.

In literature, Oates says that the classics have demoted other works, that

> ...the elevation of "mainstream" and predominantly "realistic" writing has
> created a false topology in which numerous genres are perceived as inferior
> to, or at least significantly different from, the mainstream.

Oates claims that, in part, the difference between "Gothic" (her preferred term)
work and literary work is as the difference between Plato and Aristotle - the
difference between what may be and what actually is. That's a bold way of
saying, I think, that horror (and likely genre fiction in general) is the realm
of imagination, an exploration of what could be, that doesn't seem to be readily
apparent in literary fiction. Okay, I'm not so sure what she's really trying to
get at with this, but what she comes to next did strike a chord with me.

She goes on to talk about the weaknesses in horror fiction, saying that any
problem lies in the quality of execution. She addresses one of my favorite
authors, H.P. Lovecraft, who I'll readily admit is not always easy to read.
Briefly, she said that:

> "Phenomena" rather than "persons" are the logical heroes of stories, one
> consequence of which is two-dimensional, stereotypical characters about whom
> it is difficult to care.

Yup, big problem. Often in horror, you see the situation or circumstances
overshadow any attention to the characters themselves, so often, when the
characters struggle through circumstances that culminate in a victory or defeat,
you don't care. The kids who get slaughtered at summer camp were just fodder for
the serial killer, and no one shed a tear over them. She wraps up by saying:

> The standards for horror fiction should be no less than those for "serious,
> literary" fiction in which originality of concept, depth of characters, and
> attentiveness to language are vitally important.

I'll take those standards to heart.

**_Acceptance Speech: The 2003 National Book Award for Distinguished
Contribution to American Letters_, Stephen King**

Long title and a long speech. The bulk of his speech contained thanks to those
who supported him and a brief summary of his life and work. But the core of
what's important in his speech can be summed up in two words: Write Honestly.

What's that mean? King talks about how often people talk of genre writers as
being only concerned with making money. He says for him, that's as far from the
truth as you can get. He says that had he written with fame and fortune in mind,
he would not have been successful because those are nothing but distraction. I
agree.

He talks about how he tries to stay true to human nature, even though he writes
about fantastic situations. That, when an elevator falls, people are much more
likely to scream "Oh shit!" than spout out things like "Goodbye, Neil, I will
see you in heaven." That for him, staying true means writing the "Oh shit!" line
because that's how people are more likely to react. I think he sums this up
really well:

> We understand that fiction is a lie to begin with. To ignore the truth inside
> the lie is to sin against the craft, in general, and one's own work in
> particular.

He wraps up his speech by talking about how we need to bridge the gap between
literary and popular fiction. Popular fiction is the "fiction of one's own
culture", and to ignore it is to ignore one's culture.

**_Why We Write Horror_, Michael McCarty**

Not much to this one, as it's a series of writers' responses to the question
"Whey do you write horror?" The interesting thing is, McCarty says that while a
lot of genre writers get this question, when it comes to horror, the question is
asked in the same manner one might say, "Why do you _think_ this way?"

The answers don't very too much. Several of them talk about addressing Mystery.
I like how Straub puts it:

> ...the mysterious realm that we sometimes apprehend around us, with a sense of
> the numinous, with a sense of things unknown...

Several others talk in terms of honest, very similar to what King talks about in
his acceptance speech and his other works that deal with writing. A few say that
first and foremost, they write, and that it just happens to be that horror
always seems to come out. And a few seem to say that it's just how their wired
or how they were born.

I guess all are feasible reasons. Why do I write horror? A bit of all of these,
but I think the biggest reason is the mystery. The most interesting things to me
are what happens when things get weird. In humans, as in physics, things bend
and twist in wild, wicked ways when things go to extremes. The rules seem to
change, or we learn that the rules weren't what they seemed or didn't exist at
all.
