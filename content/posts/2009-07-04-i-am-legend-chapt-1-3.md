Matheson's first three chapters do something I always find very difficult to
pull off.  He managed to develop a character in isolation, without having any
benefit of dialog with another character.  The description and narration combine
well to bring out poor Robert Neville's ordinary world.

I think Matheson also does a great job of building up the attackers through
their actions (and the one who constantly taunts - "Come out, Neville!").   He
makes it through two full chapters before referring to them outright as
"vampires", giving the reader plenty of material to work with before falling
into stereotypes of the vampire.  By the time we get to the explicit statement,
we as readers have been prepared for the idea that these may be vampires, but
they're not Vampires.

There's one line that really stood out for me, and I'm not exactly sure why:

> He took down a can of tomato juice, then left the room that had once belonged
> to Kathy and now belonged to his stomach.

I think part of it is the language feels a little strange - his stomach has its
own room.  But it's also the larger image.  The world is in such a state now
that what once belonged to an entire human being can now be dedicated to a
single organ.
